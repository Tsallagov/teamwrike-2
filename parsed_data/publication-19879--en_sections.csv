1,How to Create Custom Fields in Wrike,"Select a folder, project, or Space from the workspace’s left-hand Navigation panel.
Switch to the Table view.
Click the “+” sign 2 that appears on the right-hand side of the table.
Type in a name for your new field and press “Enter” on your keyboard.
Specify field properties on the pop-up which appears. You have options to:
Edit the field name
Choose a field type
Default aggregation (available for numeric custom fields: Number, Percentage, Currency, and Duration)
Select where to apply your custom fields
Designate who the field should be shared with
Click ""Create.""
Your custom field is created and added to the locations you specified in Step 5."
2,Quick FAQ,"Is there a limit to the number of custom fields?
No. You can create an unlimited number of custom fields in your account and as many custom fields to each folder, project, or space as you need."
3,What's Next?,"Where custom fields are visible?
How to edit custom fields?"
4,Feature Updates,"Log In as Another User
Security minded? For Enterprise admins, we added the option to log in as another user.
Hover and Attachments
We made it easier to download files and add them to review. Now you just hover over an attachment and click the download icon or ""Add to Review"".
Offline Requests on iOS
You're offline. You have an iPhone. You need to submit a Request. You can submit a Request from Wrike's iOS app while offline and your Request is submitted when you reconnect.
Row Numbers in Reports
Reports needed row numbers. We added them. That's all."
5,Fixes,"Email and Incorrect Formatting
Sometimes, when you created a task via email, the description wasn't formatted correctly. Now, everything works as it should.
Timelog Report and Last Week Filter
If you created a Timelog Report and filtered by last week, there were some cases where entries from the current week would show up. We took care of it, Reports show the correct tasks."
6,Feature Updates,"Wrike Inbox Sent Tab
Everyone's Wrike Inbox now has a sent tab. The tab shows all tasks where you've left a comment so it's easier to go back and find tasks.
Request Form Submission on iOS
Our iOS users out there can now use Request forms from our mobile app. Fill them out, submit them. Get going.
New Keyboard Shortcuts
Two new keyboard shortcuts joined the Wrike family: 1) Add task to Folder and 2) Add a new comment.
Collaborators and Live Editor
Collaborators can now see changes to the description field in real time (before there was a lag). This is for Wrike's browser version, not the mobile version.[OLD]Collaborators
Edit Dashboard Widget Sorting
You can change a widget's sorting order by editing it right from the Dashboard tab."
7,Fixes,"Filter by Custom Fields
Upper and lower case are no longer taken into account when you're filtering by Custom Fields. This is for the filters: contains, starts with, ends with, and equal to.
Jumping on Stream
Before: If you opened a Folder's Stream, in some cases the tasks would jump around when you clicked on an item. We changed that so that it doesn't happen anymore."
8,Feature Updates,"Wrike Meetings in Labs
We've always said Wrike is great for running meetings and we're taking things a step further. Enable Wrike Meetings from Labs to start calls with members of your Wrike account and get work done.[OLD][Internal] Wrike Meetings
Wrike's Desktop App in Labs
All the features we know and love from the browser version, are now available in our new desktop app. Use it to stay on top of your Inbox notifications, and keep Wrike open without using up a browser tab (or tabs).
Outlook Actionable Messages
Out of beta and into production. Anyone who uses Office 365 can now use Outlook Actionable Messages.
Email Notification Split Up
It's a breakup, but a happy one. We've split up email notifications so that you can get notifications for @mentions OR assignments, you don't have to get both anymore if you don't want to.
Search + Consolidation on the Android App
We improved search so now you see suggested items as soon as you start searching.
There are 2 tabs on the Browse view now instead of 3. The new Quick Access tab shows items from the old Recent and Starred tabs.
Custom Fields on Audit Reports
Audit Reports now track changes to Custom Field settings. So if someone changed the field type, name, or who it's shared with, you'll see that.
Goodbye ""Later"" in Daily To-Dos
The ""Later"" button in the Daily To-Do email is now called the ""Postpone for 1 month"" button. AKA the procrastination button."
9,Product,"Back it Up...Undo in the Request Form Builder
After taking certain actions, admins now see an undo button for 10 seconds in the Request Form Builder. So whether you change your mind about something or clicked something by mistake (it happens to all of us), we're there for you.
Custom Logos
We're consolidating. Instead of having to upload two separate logos, you'll now use the same logo for both a branded Workspace and branded email notifications.
Comments in Inbox
For two days earlier this week, you may have noticed that notifications showed up in Inbox if you commented on a task. We listened to your feedback and rolled back the release so we can fine-tune things.
Beta Program for Recurrent Tasks
We're currently running a beta program for a new version of recurrent tasks. Email our Support team at support@team.wrike.com if you're interested in participating."
10,Fixes,"Image Orientation
Before: In some cases, images may have shown up oriented the wrong way, but only in Wrike. Now: if an image is oriented correctly before you upload it, then you'll see it oriented correctly in Wrike as well.
OneDrive Attachments
Before: You couldn't attach files from OneDrive using the attachment button in the comment section. Now: you can attach OneDrive files just fine."
11,Feature Updates,"Board View See More/Hide More
Before you could only see tasks from one workflow at a time on the Board View. Now, if there are tasks in a different workflow, you'll see an ""Other tasks"" column with those tasks.
You can also collapse columns if you don't want to see tasks with a particular status.
Matching Attachment Extensions
You can add different versions of an attachment. Now when you upload a new version of an attachment, it should be the same type of file (for example .doc) as the previous version of the attachment.
Edit Custom Dashboard Widgets
We live in a new world. If you create a Custom Widget you can now edit it (instead of having to delete and recreate it). Celebrate with us. Important exception: you can't edit the pre-built Dashboard widgets, widgets with Custom Field filters, or Analytics widgets.
Unread Inbox Notifications
Mark Inbox notifications as unread and keep an eye on the notifications that matter most to you."
12,Fixes,"User Group Filters on Timelog Reports
Filtering by User Groups wasn't working properly in Timelog Reports. Fixed, so now when you filter a Timelog Report by a User Group, the Report contains the timelog entries added by members of this User Group."
13,Feature Updates,"Reports - Facelift, Aggregation, and More
Reports not only look nicer (larger font, better color-coding), but aggregation values now also show up on Reports, we improved sorting of and within Groupings, wrap text works with more fields, and auto-saving for formatting options. Read more details here.
Filter Inbox
In Wrike's Inbox, you can now choose to see all your notifications or just the unread ones.
Images on the Board View
Images now show up on the Board View. What does that mean? The most recent image you've attached to a task appears on the VIew. For our word-friendly friends, you can hide images if you'd rather not see them.
Proofing Marker Color Enhancements
Proofing markers aren't just pink anymore - there are 6 color options so it's easier to see who made which comment. Go ahead, taste the rainbow.
Dynamic Request Forms on Android
Before you couldn't use dynamic Request forms on the Android app (:cry:), but now you can!
Request Form Editing Options
You add a dropdown or checkmark question to a form, then realize the answer options should be in a different order. We've all been there (all right, only some of us). Well, now you can drag and drop answers into the right order without starting all over again.
Recent Tasks and User Search (in Labs)
The latest Wrike Labs feature lets you see your most recently used tasks and even search for other people in your Wrike account.
Security Improvements: See something, Say Something
Noticed a Security vulnerability in Wrike? Report if from our Security page."
14,Feature Updates,"Comment Spellchecker
In a much-requested move, we've enabled a beta version of a spellchecker in Wrike Labs. *Insert sigh of relief from all of us who need spelling help*.
Outlook Actionable Messages
Outlook Actionable Messages let you make changes to a Wrike task right from the email notification you receive. Want to try it out? Reach out to our team at support@team.wrike.com.
Fixes
Submitting External Forms
For a short time, when someone submitted an external Request form an error message appeared stating that the request wasn't submitted even though it was. Everything is fixed now. The error message is gone, requests are being submitted, tasks and Projects are being created.
Conflicts Monitor Malfunction
Conflicts weren't appearing on the Conflicts Monitor Dashboard widget or in analytics. Taken care of and conflicts show up again."
15,Feature Updates,"Subtask and Task Statuses
Subtasks and Tasks are getting a little closer. Now, when you complete an active parent task, you'll be asked if you want to complete any active subtasks as well. There's more to it, read more on our task page.
Dynamic Request Form Upgrades
Admins can now amp up their Request forms. Add assignees or parent Folders based on the answers a respondent chooses on dropdown or checkbox questions. Or trigger a Project from different templates based on which dropdown answer is selected. Learn more on our dynamic Request form page.
UI Name Changes
You can search for Folders and Projects in the left-hand Folder tree. The functionality hasn't changed, but now instead of ""Search"" the Folder panel says ""Filter""."
16,Fixes,"Broken Request Forms
In certain cases when users tried to open a Request form, they got an error message. Fixed, all Request forms work properly now."
17,Feature Updates,"Approval Filters in Reports
Approvals filters in task Reports and Approvals filters from the List View are in line now - aka the filters are the same in both places. Check out the Approvals Help Center page for a reminder of what Approval filters are available.
Proofing Comment
Before: You had to click a button in the Proofing viewer to see the comments panel. Now: Just click the image. If there are comments, then the comments panel opens. If there are no comments yet, a dot marker is added to the image and you can start typing your comment.
CAPTCHA on External Request Forms
External Request Forms are now protected with CAPTCHA (the program that asks you to enter some information to prove that you're a real person and not a robot)."
18,Fixes,"Workflow Names in Report Snapshots
In some cases, column-type Report Snapshots displayed workflow IDs instead of workflow names (even though the Reports themselves were fine). The same thing happened with status groups and Project Owners. Everything's fixed now. IDs are out, names are in.
Signed PDFs in Preview
PDFs which were signed via e-signature weren't opening in preview. Now they are.
Local File Links in Descriptions
Before: If you inserted a link to a local file with a file:// prefix to a Task, Folder, or Project's description, the link didn't work. Now: Links to local files work fine (because we whitelisted the ""file://"" prefix). Kudos to you if you know what that means."
19,Feature Updates,"The Beginning of Offline on iOS
We've made the first foray into offering some offline features for iOS. For this release, we've updated the app so that now, if you've opened a task while online and then go offline you'll still be able to read the information from that task. For now, offline view is a read-only view so you can't make changes while offline.
Task Stream on iOS
There's an updated task stream on iOS which makes it easier to distinguish comments from other updates.
Timeline and Workload View on Android
Android now has a faster Timeline View and now you can also use the Workload View from the app! Click the Folder menu button and select ""View on Workload"" to open the Workload View."
20,Fixes,"Remind Password Option on Mobile
If you tried using the ""Forgot password"" option from a mobile app (we all have to at some point), the page opened but it didn't look so hot. Now it looks nice and spiffy again.
Text Mix-Up in Email Notifications
Before, email notifications about Folders and Projects stated ""You got this update because you created the task"". We've cleared things up and now if the notification is about a Folder/Project it says so."
21,Feature Updates,"Duplicating Tasks
Before tasks duplicates were always created in the same Folder as the original task, but now you can choose to have the duplicate created in a different Folder.
Large Files Upload Faster
In most browsers, large files (files bigger than 10MB) now get uploaded to Wrike faster. Upload speed has not changed in Internet Explorer or Edge.
Microsoft Teams Enhancements (yes, there's more than one)
First: We all love drag and drop and now you can drag and drop tasks on the List View in Microsoft Teams. This is synced with the priority sorting order of the List View in the desktop version of Wrike.
Second: From the List View in MS Teams, you can still choose to see all tasks (with all statuses) or you can filter tasks to just see those with an active status.
Webinar Page Localized
Our new webinar page is now available in French, German, Italian, Spanish, and Russian. We may be biased, but we think they look great."
22,Fixes,"Malfunctioning Links
Some links (for example, ones starting with conisio:// and smb://) weren't working properly if you included them in Wrike tasks. Fixed, now the links are working fine."
23,Feature Updates,"More Filters on the Board View
We heard your requests and we added more filters to the Board View. Now, you can use all the filters you know and love from the view (with the exception of status filters and review related filters). Start sorting.
Downloading Files from the Proofing Viewer
You could download files from the Proofing Viewer before but we wanted to make it easier: now it's one click instead of two. Just use the download button to the right of the file's name.
Duration Column in Exported Reports
We've worked some magic and now when you have a Report which shows the ""Duration"" column, that column is exported to Excel (if you export the Report to Excel of course).
Profile Button in Microsoft Teams
Wrike and Microsoft Teams just got a little more personal. Edit your Wrike profile details (name, phone number, and email address) directly from MS Teams.
Folder Tree Preferences
Collapse or expand the sections in your Folder tree (the starred section, Folders or Projects with Subfolders and Subprojects, or entire accounts), and Wrike will remember* your settings the next time you open Wrike in your browser or log back in. *Give it a few minutes before exiting Wrike in order for your savings to be saved."
24,Video Release Notes,"Check out video release notes, or read about this week's updates below."
25,Feature Updates,"Board View Enhancements
Folder Info Panel. Folder and Project info panels are now easy to reach from the Board View - just click the icon in the view's upper right-hand corner.
Task importance. Change a task's importance from the Board View as well. Right click on a task, hover over importance and select the appropriate importance level. Just a reminder: in Wrike (and life) importance and priority mean different things.
Tasks in Salesforce Templates
You can now have up to 250 tasks in Wrike Salesforce templates.
Project Wizard
The Project Wizard is a feature from Wrike Labs. The wizard is getting smarter - before the ""List View"" was always preselected as the default view option. Now, for Subfolders and Subprojects, the wizard preselects the same default view that's applied to the parent Folder or Project. If you're creating a top-level Folder, then the wizard preselects the same default view option as the last Folder/Project you created."
26,Fixes,"Avatars in Internet Explorer and Edge
If you use Internet Explorer or Edge you may have noticed that some profile pictures were replaced with an ""x"" instead of the images you're used to seeing. We fixed the disappearing act and now you can see your (and your teammates) avatars again.
Thumbnails in the Daily Digest
Image thumbnails from task descriptions weren't loading correctly in the Daily Digest. It's all taken care of now, and you can see your thumbnails again."
27,Video Release Notes,"Check out video release notes, or read about this week's updates below."
28,Feature Updates,"Request Forms
Dynamic Request forms: With dynamic Request forms you can trigger follow-up questions based on what answer someone selects to a dropdown-type question.
Forms with multiple pages: Admins can now divide questions on to multiple pages in order to make dynamic Request forms (or just to add a little organization).
YouTube Video Attachments
We've added control for admins on Enterprise accounts. You can now restrict users from attaching YouTube videos to tasks.
Android Update
The Browse View got some new sections: You can now browse by ""Recent"" (recent tasks), ""Starred"" (starred Folders and Projects) or Everything (all of your Tasks, Folders, and Projects).
Comment reactions are no longer desktop only - you can now add reactions from Android as well.
For all us who like to mass edit tasks, you can now use some mass editing options on the Android app.
Project Wizard (a Wrike Labs feature)
Now adjust share settings right from the Project Wizard. Choose who new Folders and Projects are shared with or view who new Subfolders and Subprojects are shared with (and share them with more people)."
29,Fixes,"Logo on External Request Forms
Before: When Business and Enterprise admins updated a custom logo, the old logo still appeared on the external Request form. Now: It may take an hour, but the new logo will appear on the external Request form."
30,Video Release Notes,"Check out video release notes, or read about this week's updates below."
31,Feature Updates,"Board View Release
The Board View is out of Labs! This new view shows tasks as cards and organizes them into columns based on their status. Drag and drop tasks between columns to change their status. And not to sound cliché, but: there's no set up required.
iOS App Updates
Create tasks. To make it easier for you to create new tasks, we moved the green create task icon to the bottom of the app.
Keep things updated. From the Browse View, swipe down to sync your Folder tree in iOS with the latest version from the desktop version of Wrike.
Folder/Project picker update. When you add a task to a Folder or Project, the Folders and Projects you've looked at most recently appear at the top of the list.
Request Form Builder Stability Improvement
In a win for all admins who create new Request forms: we've improved stability when you're rearranging questions on forms via drag and drop."
32,Fixes,"Workload View Repositioning
Before on the Workload View: If you rescheduled or reassigned tasks via drag and drop, clicked ""Open task"", or changed a task's duration, then the view scrolled up. Now: It's fixed, you can make changes and the view stays in the same spot it was before.
Improved PDF Zoom
Before: When you zoomed in or out on a .pdf file in the Proofing viewer, the file temporarily disappeared from view (until it reloaded at the appropriate zoom level). Now: Your .pdf files don't disappear from view when you zoom."
33,Video Release Notes,"Check out video release notes, or read about this week's updates below."
34,Feature Updates,"Launch Templates from a Request Form
Not only can Request submissions create tasks and Projects, but now Request submissions can also trigger Projects to be launched from templates (admins set this up).
Frame-by-Frame Video Proofing
For those of you who get into the nitty-gritty of videos, you can now move a video forward or backward by a single frame.
Task Stream Updates
Replying to updates: Now, when a change is made by one teammate, you can hover over their update (in the task stream) and click Reply. When you do that, the comment box prepopulates with an @mention to the person you're replying to.
Delete comment button moved: The button is still there, it just got a new home. Now you can delete your comment by hovering over it, clicking the menu button, and then selecting ""Delete"".
Board View Filters (Labs Feature)
You can now filter tasks by assignee or author on the Board View. Ready, set, filter."
35,Fixes,"Adding Attachments Comments
In the new task stream, it wasn't possible to attach a file to a comment via drag and drop. This functionality was available in the old stream, and now it's back.
Page Up and Down in Task View
Situation: You're using Chrome, you open a task in a separate tab, you made a change to the description field, and then pressed the Page Up or Page Down buttons. Result: The task view broke. Now, everything works as it should and you can Page Up or Page down to your heart's content."
36,Video Release Notes,
37,Feature Updates,"Microsoft Teams and Wrike
Microsoft launched Teams on Tuesday and we released Wrike for Microsoft Teams. Use the integration to work with Wrike tasks from your messaging app. So when watercooler talk turns into work talk, we've got you covered.
Project Wizard and Default View in Labs
Once enabled from Labs, the Project Wizard helps you create new Projects and Folders. Add some basic details (instead of just a Project/Folder name) and choose a default view. What's a default view? The view that a Project opens in when you click on it. For example, you have a Project open in the Table View instead of the List View."
38,Fixes,"Spacing in Reactions
If multiple people reacted to a comment, then their names were listed right next to each other (without a space). We fixed the clingy tendency and now there's a space between names.
YouTube Video Replay
Let's say you uploaded a YouTube video to the Workspace, watched it, and then tried to jump back to a specific point in the video or tried to click play to watch it again. Before: Nothing happened. Womp womp. Now: The video starts playing again.
Redesigned Navigation in Labs
Before, if you had the redesigned navigation enabled from Wrike Labs, the left-hand panel opened more often than people wanted it to. Now the left-hand nav only opens when you click the hamburger icon or the Projects tab."
39,Feature Updates,"Comment Reactions in the Workspace
Now you can react to comments in Wrike with emojis. Use emoji's to show that you've read something, or indicate how you feel about something.
Comments
Now, if a comment has five lines or less, you see the full comment. If a comment has more than five lines, then you'll see the ""show more"" option. Here's to more reading and less clicking.
View Video Upload Limits
Account owners, on accounts with Proofing and Approvals, can now see how much space you have left for video uploads for the month. Your video storage tracker automatically resets each month so you can keep track of how many more uploads you can do. Check this information on the Subscription tab in the Account Management section of the Workspace.
Request Form Builder Updates
We've made a few improvements to the Request Form Builder to make it easier to use:
The ""Save"" and ""Publish"" buttons were removed from the right-hand panel, but they are where you need them, at the bottom of the Request form. Added bonus: they're always visible on your form (no need to scroll to the bottom).
You'll see a green ""Published"" bar for published forms, and a gray ""Draft"" bar for draft forms. So it's easier to see if a Request form is Published or saved as a Draft."
40,Fixes,"Comments Added to Tasks
Let's say you started typing a comment in a task and then, without posting your comment, you quickly switch to another task. Sometimes the text you started typing in the first task showed up in the comment field of the second task. This doesn't happen anymore, comments stay where they're supposed to.
Subtasks on the Table View
Situation: You have a task with a subtask in Folder Awesome. The subtask also lives in Folder Rockstar. You complete the parent task, then you open Folder Awesome in the Table View (with the ""All Active"" filter applied) and make changes to the subtask. Before: After making the changes, the subtask disappeared from the view. Now: The subtask remains visible (like it's supposed to)."
41,Feature Updates,"Stream Facelift
The Workspace's Streams (the Stream tab, Stream View, and task stream) got a facelift. The spiffy new design gives comments a different background color than other task updates so that you can more easily see comments.
Time Stamps on Video Proofing
When you make a comment on a video, the comment stream in the Proofing viewer shows the timestamp for when on the video the comment was made. For example, if you make the comment ""great day!"" at 30 secs on a video, the panel shows that the comment is at 30 seconds.
Editing Billing Data
We've beefed up security, and now we ask account owners to enter their password to confirm that they want to make changes when they edit the account's billing details. (SSO users are exempt from this)."
42,Fixes,"Sharing Request Forms
Before when you duplicated a Request form, your share settings weren't saved. Now they are. Duplicate in peace."
43,Feature Updates,"Video Proofing
Video Proofing is out of Labs and available in the Workspace (for anyone with Proofing and Approvals or on Wrike for Marketers)! Now you can attach video files in Wrike and add comments directly to the video (to make communicating about revisions easier).
New Markup Tools
Proofing got some new markup tools. Instead of just a circle, you can now use an arrow, rectangle, and free draw tool. There's also a text highlight tool for .pdf files. Time to show off your drawing talent.
Wrike's Extension for Adobe Premier Pro
You can now add Wrike's Adobe Extension to Adobe Premier Pro, so video gurus can work in their tool but still access Wrike info.
Board View Enhancement
The Board View is a Wrike Labs feature. Before you could only see tasks from a particular Folder/Project on a Board, now you can now see tasks from descendant Subfolders/Subprojects as well. More information for you and your team."
44,Fixes,"Unfollow Link in Email Notifications
Wrike email notifications temporarily didn't have the link to unfollow tasks. The link, along with an explanation of why you received the email notification are back!"
45,Feature Updates,"Undo Decision on Approvals
For all of us who sometimes click too quickly, there's now an ""Undo decision"" button that appears for approvers after clicking ""Approve"" or ""Changes required"" on a file you've been assigned to review.
Updated Video Tutorials in Workspace.
We've added our new how-to videos directly into the Workspace. Click ""Video Tutorials"" in the left-hand corner of the Workspace footer to see the videos.
Labs Feature Update: Board View
On the Board View, you can now see tasks from descendant Folders/Subfolders (before you could only see tasks from that particular Folder/Project).
Now you can delete tasks on the Board View from the new context menu. To get to the context menu: hover over the task and click the three dots that appear, or right click on the task. Purge carefully."
46,Fixes,"Tasks on Dashboard Widgets
Dashboard Widgets are created from Folders/Projects. Before: If a Dashboard was shared with you, but the Folder/Project wasn't, you would see a message that said ""No tasks"". Now: You'll see a message that the Folder was deleted or that you don't have access to it.
G Suite and Inviting New Users
This was a short-lived problem, but for a couple days admins on accounts integrated with G Suite saw a server-side error when they invited people from the linked G Suite domain. Fixed, admins can now invite users just fine."
47,Feature Updates,"Request Form Sharing
Now when you create a Request you can choose who sees it. Share your Request form with all users in the account, select users and groups, or make it available externally only.
Default Values in Request Forms
For dropdown and checkbox type question Request forms - admins can choose to have a default option selected. For example, if you have a ""Priority"" dropdown on your form, you can have the default selection be ""Low"".
Redesigned Workspace Header
You'll notice a change if you have the ""Navigation Redesign"" enabled from Labs. Now, there's no more ""..."" at the top of the Workspace, instead all of the Global Views are listed across the top of the Workspace for easier access.
iOS App
It just got a little easier to view images in the iOS app - you can click on images directly from the task view to see a preview.
For all of us who forget our passwords, you can now click ""Login with Google"" and if you are logged in to your Google account in one of your phone's browsers, then you'll be automatically logged in to Wrike."
48,Fixes,"Google Drive Attachments
Before: A button for downloading Google Drive files was available, but if you clicked it, files weren't downloaded to your computer. Now: The ""Download"" button doesn't show up for Google Drive attachments, so there's less confusion."
49,Feature Updates,"Request Form Upgrades
Admins can now duplicate Request Forms, so you don't always have to start from scratch.
Some Form settings moved to the right-hand side of the page.
For externally available Requests, admins no longer see the ""Contact Information"" block on the form builder, but users filling out the form via the link are still asked to enter their contact info.
Increased User Groups
In a victory for anyone who uses User Groups: we increased the number of User Groups accounts can have. Now everyone can have at least 21 User Groups (including the My Team group).
Edit Billing Info
Before: It wasn't possible to edit billing info; you could only delete the old card and add a new one. Now: You can edit billing details (like credit card info and billing address).
iOS App Push Notifications
You're in control - at least of your notifications. Now you can: disable or enable all notifications. Or enable only Inbox notifications but disable Stream related updates (like description field updates, changed status, etc). Feel the power."
50,Fixes,"Parent Folder Grouping in Reports
This one came back, but should be fixed for good now. Situation: You have a Task, Folder or Project that ""lives"" in multiple parent Folders/Projects. You create a Report that includes data from one of the parent Folders/Projects and group by ""Parent Folder"". Before: The Task or Project showed up under all of their parent Folders. Now: The Task/Project shows up only under the parent Folder that the Report is based on.
Dashboards Limit and Wrike for Marketers
Before: Users on Wrike for Marketers (Business or Enterprise) could only create up to 10 Dashboards. Now: Wrike for Marketers (WfM) users can have up to 15 Dashboards, WfM Enterprise users - up to 20 Dashboards.
Reports Scheduling
If you subscribed to a Report and wanted to have the Report sent on the half hour, the time reverted back to the hour when you tried to save. Fixed."
51,Feature Updates,"Board View in Labs
The Board View is a spiffy new view that let's you see tasks organized into columns based on their status. Enable the new view from Wrike Labs.
Create a Project via Forms
Now Admins can more quickly kickoff Projects by opting to have a Project (instead of a task) created when a Request is submitted."
52,Fixes,"Excel Export from Reports
Before: When you exported a Report from Wrike to Excel, Date and Number type Custom Fields were exported as text. Now: They're exported as dates and numbers (unless you checked the box next to ""Use 1000 separator"", we're still working on that use case).
Add User with Incorrect Email
Before: If you clicked ""Add Users"" in the Workspace footer and entered an incorrect email, the window would close, but the invitation wouldn't send. Now: The ""Invite users"" window doesn't close and the incorrect email is highlighted so you can make changes."
53,Feature Updates,"Video Proofing in Labs
Video Proofing is in Wrike Labs and available to anyone with Proofing and Approvals. Let the editing begin. Account Admins in the United States can enable the feature, and once enabled, all users on the account can use it. Use video proofing to add comments to specific times on a video.
Android App Update
You can now see Subfolders and Subprojects in the Task List from the app's Browse section.
Inbox Notifications
Now notifications are sticking around longer, they remain in Inbox for 4 weeks (instead of 2)."
54,Fixes,"Sunset of Old Wrike
Before: If you visited Wrike.com from an unsupported browser version, then you saw an old version of the Workspace. Now: You see a page asking you to update your browser so that you can start using Wrike.
Inbox Notifications
Situation: You have an Inbox notification card open, and a new notification about the same Task, Folder, or Project comes in. Before: The incoming notification wasn't marked as read. Now: It is.
Timelog View Entries Limit
Before: There was no limit to how many entries showed up in the Timelog View. However, the page crashed if there were too many tasks with Timelog entries. Now: A maximum of 1000 entries can appear on the Timelog View. Just select a different time frame to see a different range of entries."
55,Feature Updates,"iOS App Update
New year, updated iOS app. Some big changes: 1) The navigation menu is at the bottom of the app (instead of in a side navigation panel), 2) Reply to an @mention directly from push notifications, and 3) The app is now faster and more stable."
56,Fixes,"Bullet Point Indention
The indent and unindent buttons in the description field worked inconsistently. Now: Fixed. You can indent and unindent lists to your heart's content.
Edit Custom Workflows
Situation: You can't move the first status in Active and Completed groups within a workflow. Before: You could drag the first status to a different slot, but the changes wouldn't save, the first status remained the first status. Now: You can't drag and drop the first status to a different slot."
57,Feature Updates,"Report templates
Report templates left the nest (aka Wrike Labs) and are now available to anyone with access to Reports.
Workload View
Traditionally the Workload View has shown tasks from particular Folders or Projects. Now: Click ""Show full workload"" to see tasks (which are shared with you), from all other Folders and Projects as well. This should help give you a more complete picture of what someone is working on.
Now: If you use Effort Allocation (a Wrike Labs feature) you'll see effort calculated in hours on the Workload View (and can enter effort in hours on the Table View), instead of in percentages.
Email Notification Settings
You can unsubscribe from email notifications related to when: 1) A Report is shared with you, 2) A scheduled Report is ready for review. It's a holiday present: a little more control over emails, one notification setting at a time.
Updated Gmail Gadget
Notable changes: 1) The gadget now was a new, modern design. 2) After you create a task from the gadget you'll have the option to edit the task from the gadget or open it in Wrike. 3) Last but not least, performance has improved significantly and many old bugs were eliminated.

58,Fixes,"PDF Files in Internet Explorer 11
Before: .pdf files didn't open in IE 11. Now: They do.
Parent Folder Grouping in Reports
Situation: You apply a grouping by Parent Folder in a Report and some of the items in the Report belong to Folders / Projects which aren't shared with you. Before: The items were grouped by Parent Folder but you saw ""Null"" as a grouping title for Folders that weren't shared with you. Now: If you don't have access to a Folder/Project, then items aren't grouped by that Folder on your Report."
59,Feature Updates,"Collapsible Left-Hand Navigation Panel in Labs
Enable the option to hide the left-hand Navigation panel from Wrike Labs. With the new update: 1) the Navigation panel is now exclusively a Folder tree and 2) The tabs that lived in the panel before (Dashboard, Inbox, etc) now run along the top of the Workspace.

""Highlight Overdue"" on the Timeline and Workload Views
Now, by default, overdue tasks appear in the color associated with their status but you can check the box next to ""Highlight overdue"" to mark the tasks red."
60,Fixes,"#xme Search Command
Before: If you used the #xme search command, you would see search results that didn't match that filter criteria. Now: When you use the search command #xme you see only tasks created by you or assigned to you (which is how it should work).
Report Reminders
Before: You could only schedule Report reminders to be delivered on the hour (8, 9, 10am, etc). Now: You can schedule Report reminders to be delivered on the hour or on the half hour (8:30, 9:30, 10:30 etc.). The default reminder time is 8 AM."

Emojis now show up in Inbox notifications. Enjoy those smileys.
Subscribing to Reports
The ability to subscribe to Reports is out of Labs and available for anyone with access to Reports.

Android App Update
We rolled out new ways to access the Android app. For app versions 4.3 - 5.1 we have PIN access and for app versions 6.0+ we have PIN and fingerprint access. Visit app settings to set up either."
62,Fixes,"Compact Task List
Before: If you enabled the Compact Task List from Labs, then created a new task and clicked anywhere, the Task View didn't open. Instead, you had to open the task manually. Now: The logic is the same as with the regular task list (List View). When you create a task and then click anywhere, the Task View automatically opens.
Entering Assignees
Before: From the Table View: 1) You used the tab key to switch to the ""Assignee"" column, 2) Began typing someone's name, 3) Hit enter to select a user, 4) The assignee cell remained empty. Now: The assignee's name appears in the cell.[OLD]Old Table View Overview
Hiding Empty Folders

Enable the Google Calendar integration to create Google Calendar events from Wrike tasks. So, now you can schedule task-related meetings, create events as task reminders, and show exactly when tasks are due on your calendar.

Just in time for the holiday season, the editing toolbar in the description field got a UI upgrade, so now icons look cleaner and more modern.
Report Wizard Update.
We increased performance for the Report Builder (for all of us out there with large Folder structures) and made it easier to use. Before: You had to use ""Back"" and ""Next"" buttons to switch between panels on the Report Builder. Now: You can make changes to any part of the wizard without having to click ""Back"" or ""Next"".
Android App Enhancements
The task Stream on the Android app got a facelift: now comments appear in bubbles so they are easier to distinguish from other updates."
64,Fixes,"Folder Tag Order in Reports
Before: The order of tags in the List and Task View didn't match the order of tags in Reports. Now: Tags appear in the same order on the Task View, List View, and Reports.
Subtask Button for Collaborators
From the task view, Collaborators could see a list of subtasks (if the task had them) but couldn't see the subtasks button. Now: They see subtasks and the button."

Currently in Labs. Anyone with access to a Report can now subscribe to it so that you receive reminders to check out the Report. You'll get an Inbox notification and email with a link to the Report.
iOS App
We have a new version of our iOS app. Some highlights: faster app (rejoice!), support for login via Office 365, and usability improvements for the description field.
Custom Fields Dropdown
Before: All Custom Fields dropdowns were flexible, you could select a dropdown value or enter something else. Now: You can have flexible dropdowns or strict dropdowns, where you can only select certain values (you can't enter a value not in the dropdown list).
Mobile Icons in Streams
If you make an update from a mobile device, the task stream shows a mobile icon next to the update on task Activity Steams and in the regular Stream tab. The mobile icon does not appear when you access Wrike from a mobile app."
66,Fixes,"Firefox Remove Groupings
Before: In Firefox, you could not remove Report groupings. Now: You can.
Party Themes Without Party Fouls
This was a short-lived bug. Before: If you had a party theme enabled in Labs, then there was no dividing line between the Task List and the Task View. Now: The dividing line appears (as it should)."
67,Feature Updates,"Android App
Wrike's Android app got a big UI update. Items from the left-hand panel (Inbox, My Work, Dashboard, Folders) are now located in a bottom toolbar.
Cleaned Up Reports
There used to be small icons to the left of the words ""Edit"" and ""Shared"" on Reports. We removed the icons to make the Reports View cleaner."
68,Fixes,"Subtask Sorting on the Table View
Before: Subtasks on the Table View were sorted based on the order they were added in. Now: Subtasks are sorted alphabetically (by title).[OLD]Old Table View Overview
Report Snapshots (Table Format)
Before: You couldn't open a task from a table-type Report Snapshot (even if you had access to it). Now: When you click on a task from a Snapshot and you have access to it, the task opens. If you don't have access to the task, you see an error message and the task does not open."
69,Feature Updates,"Report Snapshots
You can now share Report Snapshots with anyone - Wrike users and non-Wrike users alike.
Sharing Wrike Reports
We've made three updates to Reports: 1) The option to share Wrike Reports is out of Labs and available on all Business and Enterprise subscriptions. 2) Now, you receive an email notification when someone shares a Report with you. 3) Users who a Report is shared with can no longer export it to Excel.
Changed Titles
We cleaned up bulk rescheduling options. 1) Instead of ""Next week"", the option now reads ""Monday, next week"". 2) Due to low usage we removed the ""This week"" scheduling option (for mass actions). Think of it as spring cleaning. In November.
Mobile Apps in Footer
The eagle-eyed among you may have noticed a ""Mobile apps"" link in the Workspace's footer. Use the link to have a download app link sent to your phone."
70,Fixes,"Mass Actions
You use mass actions to reschedule tasks with durations less than 24 hours. Before: Their durations were reset to 1 day. Now: Durations stay intact.
Strikethroughs in Description Fields
With the description field updates: clicking a checkbox caused that text to have a strikethrough. We corrected the behavior and now items are only grayed out when you check them off. Strikethroughs, struck out.
Description Field Adjustments
We made a few spacing modifications based on feedback from last week's description field update. 1) Reduced line height in bulleted and numbered lists. 2) Reduced the margins above headings (if the heading is the first item in the task). 3) Reduced the spacing on the right side of the description field."
71,Feature Updates,"Description Field Facelift
Description fields got a design facelift. You'll notice UI improvements for text, spacing, checkboxes, and tables.

72,Fixes,"Filtering Custom Fields
Before: If you created a date-type Custom Field, you could not filter a Report by that Custom Field. Now: You're able to filter Reports by date.
Automatic Duration Updates
Before: You had a backlogged task. You set a date for the task, but the duration field didn't update until you clicked ""OK"" or clicked somewhere on the date picker. Now: The task's duration updates automatically."
73,Feature Updates,"Share Wrike Reports
Wrike Reports got two big updates: 1) You can now share Reports with External Users and Collaborators. 2) When you share a report, everyone who you share the report with sees the same data you see. However, even though you can see everything the Report creator sees, you can only open Tasks, Folders, and Projects which are shared with you.
Text Wrap Out of Labs
The option to wrap text is out of labs. Text Custom Fields now automatically expand when you edit the field and you can enable or disable text wrapping on Reports.

74,Fixes,"Loading Attachments in the Description Field
If you inserted an image into a description field (via copy/paste or drag and drop), the image wouldn't load. Now: Uploading images works properly.
Unaligned Stream Updates
Before: If multiple people made updates to a task, the Stream updates for that task were unaligned. Now: People can work together on tasks and the Stream updates stay aligned."
75,Feature Updates,"Inbox Notifications
Inbox notifications got some new muscle. Now, you get an Inbox notification when someone shares a Task, Folder, or Project with you (instead of just when you're assigned or @mentioned).
Inherited Tags on Dashboards
Subtasks have inherited tags (tags passed down by default from parent tasks), now you can see a Subtask's inherited tags from the List View and on Dashboard widgets. You can also see a subtask's parent task on Dashboard widgets.
Expanded Domain Invitation Rights
Now you can have multiple approved domains (so users can invite teammates from more than one approved domain). If you're using G Suite, you can allow users to invite people from a domain other than one linked with Wrike."
76,Fixes,"Custom Workflows
Before: 1) You created a Custom Workflow 2) You left the first (default) Active status as is, and added more statuses. 3) The first Active status disappeared after you saved the workflow. Now: The Active status has stopped it's disappearing act and it remains in place after you save.
Search My Work
Before: If you were in My Work and tried searching for a task by ID, the Workspace would freeze. Now: You can search tasks by ID in My Work and the Workspace continues working as expected."
77,New Features,"Wrike and GitHub Two-Way Sync
Two-Way Sync between Wrike and GitHub is now available for all paid accounts. Developers in GitHub and Project Managers in Wrike: rejoice.
Wrike and JIRA Two-Way Sync
Now Regular Users and Admins can enable the sync (before it was only admins).
Sorting Reports
New sorting options in the Report and Report Snapshot view. You can sort by Report: name, owner, if it's shared, and last update. Go ahead and start sorting things out."
78,Fixes,"New My Work
Before: When a user was unassigned from a task in the Today or Later sections of My Work, the task didn't disappear from My Work. Now: When a user is unassigned from a task, it's removed from My Work.
New Task Assignments
Before: 1) Someone submitted a Request form and a user was automatically assigned to the resulting task. 2) The assignee didn't receive an email notification about the new assignment. Now: Task assignees receive email notifications about new tasks assigned to them (if their email notifications are turned on)."
79,New Features,"Share a Report
Report Sharing is in Wrike Labs! You can now share a report with other Regular Users and User Groups. When you share a report: users can only see Tasks/Projects that were already shared with them. If something isn't shared with them, then they won't see it on the report.[OLD]Types of Licenses"
80,Fixes,"Print Timeline
Before: If a task is in the root Folder and is backlogged, then that task's subtasks won't show up when you print the Timeline. Now: Subtasks are done hiding and you can see them just fine when you print.
Color Coding on Custom Calendars
Before: Non-working days were not grayed out on Custom Calendars (they should be). Now: They are.
First Days on Custom Calendars
Before: Custom Calendars were feeling independent and always used Sunday as the first day of the week (no matter what day you chose as the first day of the week in Settings). Now: The first day of the week you designate in Settings is also the first day of the week for Custom Calendars."
81,Feature Updates,"Long Text Field Wrap in the Table view
This is a Wrike Labs feature. To make it easier to edit text type Custom Fields, those fields now expand on the Table View while you edit them.
My Work
In the new My Work (in Labs): the option ""Unpin from My Work"" is now ""Hide from To Do"". You can also opt to ""Hide"" tasks in the Incoming section instead of moving them to ""Today"" or ""Later"".
Remove/Change Report Groupings
Editing and removing Report groupings just got a little easier. Click the ""x"" that appears on a grouping to remove it and click a grouping to see an alphabatized list of alternative grouping options. Default options are showed first, Custom Field options second.
Reviewing Reports
Before: if you opened a report, then it automatically moved to the top of the Report list (even if you didn't edit it). Now: a report only moves to the top of the list if you open and edit it.
Attachment List Updates
We made some small changes to make the file attachment list more readable."
82,Fixes,"Roll Up Custom Fields
Before: If several Custom Fields were added for a Subfolder (but not the parent Folder), then only some of the fields would show up in the ""roll up"" section of the parent Folder. Now: All Custom Fields show up.
Excel Export Error
Before: 1) You had a parent Folder with Subfolder A, Subfolder A had a Custom Field. 2) You duplicated Subolder A and now Subfolder A and its duplicate are in the same parent Folder. 3) Your tried to export the parent Folder via Excel and the export would fail. Now the export works as expected.
File Search in Wrike
After a hiatus, the search command to look for files (file:*) is back and working as it should be. Use it to find all tasks that have a specific file extension."
83,Feature Updates,"Audit Reports
You can now use Audit Reports to see which users were deleted and which were restored (after being deleted).
Search Tasks by ID
You could always search tasks by ID number. Now, you no longer need to use search commands to do so. Just type the task's ID in Wrike's search box and press enter.
Add Columns to Reports
To make it easier to find which column to add, on Table Reports and Table Report Snapshots, column options are now split into: 1) default options and 2) Custom Fields. Even better news? They're also organized alphabetically.
Highlighted Rows on Reports
Now when you right-click on a row in a list of Reports, Report Snapshots, or Requests, that row turns blue so you know which row you've selected.
iOS App Updates
You can now edit a task's description from within the task view (before a new screen would appear). The task view is also loading faster and smoother.
New Dashboard Widget
Accounts with Proofing and Approvals have a new default Dashboard widget: My Pending Reviews. The widget shows tasks where you've been assigned as a reviewer and haven't given your input yet."
84,Fixes,"PDF Input Fields Displays
Input fields on PDFs displayed as empty in the attachments viewer (even if the field was filled in). Now: The data from filled in PDF input fields is displayed.
""Archive All"" on Inbox
Before: We didn't anticipate how popular some of our users are and the option to ""Archive All"" in Inbox could actually only archive 1,000 cards. Now: Archive all really does archive all.
Delayed Dependency Update
Before: 1) If tasks were linked by a Finish to Start dependency and 2) you changed the end date of the predecessor task in the Table View, then the start date of the successor didn't change until you refreshed the page or toggled the view. Now: The successor's start date changes immediately."

Inbox Approval Notifications
Now when a reviewer approves a file (or indicates that changes are required) the file's image is shown on the notification card in Inbox.
New Buttons in Reports
We gave buttons in the upper right-hand corner of Reports a fresher, cleaner look. You can see the changes in: Column and Table Reports and in Report Snapshots."
87,Fixes,"Japanese Language Setting
When the account's language was set to Japanese and an image was in a description field: then the Folder picker was broken. This bug has been fixed.

Now: 1) Text for text-type Custom Fields can be wrapped in Table Reports (not in Task and Table Views) and 2) There are improved editing options for text-type Custom Fields in the Task View and in Folder/Project info panels.

Reports Layout Autosave
Before: To save the changes made with a report layout (Ex: changing column width, making some fields visible etc.) users needed to click ""Save"" . Now: Layout changes that a user makes are autosaved."

Before: Under certain conditions Reports were cut off after you resized the window. Now: You can resize your window until it's right for you and the Reports are displayed just fine.

Before: The ""Welcome to Wrike"" Folder was only shared with the account owner. Now: it's shared with all Regular Users who are part of the account.

Enterprise accounts can restrict login to Wrike to specific IP addresses. Now you can have restricted login, but still allow Collaborators (and only Collaborators) to log in from non-approved IP addresses.
Android App
Before, in the Android app, you had to wait for a user to accept their invite to Wrike before assigning a task to them. Now you can stay productive, and assign tasks to users immediately after sending them a Wrike invite."
93,Fixes,"Grouping in Reports
Before: If you created a Report based on one Folder, then grouped the report by parent Folder: multiple Folders may have appeared on your report (even though that's not what you wanted). Now: Things work the way you want them to and only one Folder is visible on the Report.
External Request Forms
Each task created via an external Request form has a contact information header. Before: that header was displayed twice. Now: We fixed the redundancy and now the header is only displayed once."
94,Feature Updates,"Branded forms
You can now upload a branded Workspace logo to have that logo appear on external Request form submission pages as well.
Google Drive Attachments
Instead of opening in a new browser window, Google Drive attachments now open a new tab instead."
95,Fixes,"Email Integration
Before: When a task's description contained more than 51200 characters, the .eml file was attached to the task. Now: the .html file is attached instead. .html is better than .eml so this is a win."
96,Feature Updates,"Adobe Extension + InDesign
Wrike's Adobe Extension now works with InDesign (in addition to Photoshop and Illustrator). Make sure you install the latest version of the extension. Instructions available here.

Commenting in the Office Add-in
The Microsoft Office Add-in now supports comments (viewing comments, making them, and @mentioning). Collaborate away."
97,Fixes,"Report Filters
Before: Time related filters in Reports were static. For example, if you created a Report with the Today filter on 10/18/15, then your report would always filter tasks by that date. Now: The time related filters in reports are dynamic. For example, now if you filter by ""today"" then each time you open the report you see today's tasks vs. the tasks from the day you created the report.
Images
Before: In some cases, an attached file had a normal file size when it was downloaded, but it was very small if you tried to open it in preview. Now: The file is displayed the correct size in both downloads and preview.
""Number Type"" Custom Fields
Before: if you opened a task from the Table View, and entered data in the Custom Field (from the Task View overlay), the data you entered would not appear in the Table View when you closed the Task View overlay. Now: The Table View shows the data you entered from the Task View overlay.
Old Reports
Before: Older Reports where encountering a problem where they weren't updating with new information. Now: Old reports update correctly."

You can now use Audit Log reports to monitor more changes, including: user role changes, when items are shared, and attachments being uploaded/deleted.
Streamlined Activity Stream
Before: Each Proofing comment, and all activity related to Approvals, resulted in a new entry in Activity Streams. We updated the logic to allow related activities to be grouped together. Now the stream looks more streamlined. Pun intended."
99,Bugs Fixed,"Zoom on Timeline View
For a time, you couldn't properly zoom out on the Timeline and Workload Views. We fixed it and now zoom works the way it should again.
Notifications for User Groups
In some cases, when you @mentioned a User Group, the user's in that group were not getting email notifications. That's the wrong way to get to inbox zero. The bug was fixed and now people are receiving email notifications as they should be."
100,Wrike Overview,"Wrike is an online work collaboration solution that helps teams achieve better work results faster.
With Wrike you can manage your work more efficiently:
Focus on the most important work.
Get a single hub for your work, including tasks, files, and discussions.
Spend less time on emails and meetings.
In this video, you’ll get a quick overview of Wrike navigation and key features."
101,Wrike’s Building Blocks,"Spaces, tasks, folders, and projects: These are the building blocks of Wrike.
Tasks are the actionable items you need to complete; they’re where you communicate, brainstorm, and work.
Folders and projects are ways to organize your tasks.
Projects have due dates, owners, and goals while folders are used to structure work items and tag them.
Spaces are larger buckets to store all work items related to one team or client."
102,Navigation in Wrike,"Views (List, Table, Board, Stream, Files, Gantt Chart) are the different options for how you see tasks within a folder, project, or space. The view options appear after you click on a folder/project/space.
For example, the List view shows tasks in a list, the Table view is a spreadsheet view, and the Gantt Chart visualizes your project schedules. In each case, you’re looking at the same tasks but from different angles. Learn more tips on using work views."
103,What You See in Wrike,"What you see in Wrike may differ from what your teammates have in their workspace. The reason is that you have different work items shared with you. So if something isn’t shared with you, you can’t access it. However, once something is shared with you, it appears in your workspace, and you can then view and search for it. Read more details on how sharing works.
While sharing information gives you access to work items, following allows you to receive notifications related to those items. You will automatically follow a task when you’re @mentioned or assigned to it.
Filters determine which tasks you see. By default, you only see Active tasks, but you can change your filters at any time. For example, you can set your filters to see completed tasks, tasks assigned to a certain person, or tasks scheduled for this week. You can slice and dice your data exactly the way you need by applying several filters and saving the selected configuration as a preset. There are a lot of filter options, and if you can’t find a task in a list, it’s always good to check which filters are applied."
104,Setting up Your Profile,"A personalized and up-to-date profile adds a personal touch to online collaboration.
Customize these three things to update the look and feel of your workspace:
Customize your profile: Upload your avatar, enter your job title, company name, and other information. Up-to-date profile information is vital for online team collaboration.
Choose Workspace Theme. Black or white, leopard or safari – make Wrike fit your preferences. The chosen theme will be applied to your personal workspace only.
Check out notification settings. By default, all email and product notifications are turned on. You can edit them so you only receive emails for the changes you want to track. If you’re new to Wrike, we recommend you leave the default settings and get back to fine-tuning notifications after a couple of weeks."

It’s a good idea to use the two-minute rule when dealing with notifications: If the answer takes you less than two minutes, reply to it right away. If it requires more of your time, snooze notifications to prioritize it later.
Dashboards are one of the most customizable ways to keep track of your work. They allow you to focus on your priorities and make sure that nothing falls through the cracks. On Dashboards, tasks are grouped on widgets by certain criteria, such as your overdue tasks, tasks to do this week, your backlogged tasks, etc. You can add additional widgets, like a file widget or all tasks you assigned – anything that’s important to you. Learn more about Personal Dashboard.
Another way to see your work is in the ""My to-do"" smart folder. It helps you focus on the most important tasks and contains:[OLD]Personal Space
All tasks and subtasks that are assigned to you
Tasks that you manually added to ""My to-do”
You can customize what you see in My to-do by applying filters, changing sorting order, or displaying tasks and subtasks as a plain list."

Webinar: Boost Your Personal Productivity in Wrike"
115,Overview,"Remote work may be a company policy by choice or necessity, but it can become a competitive advantage for a team. The trick is to leverage benefits (like flexible working schedules or work-life balance) and overcome challenges (such as miscommunication, distractions, or lack of human interaction).
Here are some best practices to help you make remote work more productive."
116,Personal Productivity,"Create a dedicated office space
In the same way you set boundaries between your work and home life, you also need to keep your office and personal spaces separate. Set up your workspace at a table or desk rather than a sofa or bed. You’ll get more work done, and it’s less likely that you’ll get sleepy. Find a clean, quiet, isolated workspace so you can work on your tasks in peace. Get inspired with our Wrikers’ home offices on Instagram.
Minimize distractions
Keeping focus on your tasks may be challenging when you work from home. In addition to common office work distractions such as phone and social media, you get a bonus in terms of kids and pets.
Share responsibility for young kids with your partner: Create a shared calendar so you can keep track of conference calls and take turns caring for your children. Consider having serious conversations about your work importance with older children.
One Wriker said, “My office has a door, and it's not for knocking. When the door is closed, it's like daddy has got in his car and left for the office.” Even a simple “Don’t Disturb” Post-It note on the door can help. Read more tips about working from home with children in our blogpost.
Stick to your schedule
Remote work often implies a flexible schedule. It allows you to experiment with your working time and align your schedule with your high productivity period. On the other hand, flexible schedules often result in unconscious overworking.
The trick here is to separate time for home and work (e.g., make appointments right after you finish work). You need to clearly set start and finish time for your work and communicate it both to your team and your family. You can set up your working hours in Google Calendar or Slack.
And, of course, commit to following it yourself! After your work time is over, close your laptop and do your personal stuff without checking your email or work notifications.
Prioritize your work
Limit the number of tasks you include in your daily plan. For example, list out three must-do tasks and three optional tasks. Estimate time needed to complete your tasks to make sure you set realistic plans and don’t overwork. Then make sure that task list in My to-do or your personal dashboard reflects your plan in terms of deadlines and priorities.[OLD]Personal Space
Here’s one more great tip from the Wrike community: Keep yourself accountable. Agree to have a 15-minute call/video chat at the beginning of your day and read your to-do lists to each other. It doesn't matter if they're in the same service as you or even in the same company!
Morning routines
Start your day as if you’re going to the office: Fix your bed, eat a good breakfast, dress nicely, and do your other pre-work routines so you can feel the rhythm of office life.
As you enter your home office and start your work day, visit your Inbox to check new updates and assignments. Then plan your day in My to-do and update tasks statuses, attach files, and leave comments with @mentions as you go. It will make your morning positive and productive! Learn more about daily routines.[OLD]Personal Space
Productivity methods
To get more things done in less time and with less stress, try to use one of these proven time management systems:
Pomodoro: Break your workday into 25-minute chunks separated by five-minute breaks.
80/20 rule: Focus on 20% of top tasks in your to-do list that will have the highest impact on your goal.
Two minutes rule: If the task takes you less than two minutes to complete, do it right away even if it’s not really important or urgent. If it requires more of your time, defer or delegate it.
Eat the frog: Do your most important or scariest task first in the morning so you don’t have to think about it for the rest of the day.
Taking breaks with purpose
Regular breaks throughout the day is a great way to recharge your batteries. Try to set reminders in a way that fits your schedule and work habits. And spend your breaks productively! Get away from your desk and move for at least five minutes every hour. Check out this infographic, “The Science of Productive Breaks.”

120,Team Efficiency,"Learn how to encourage team spirit, uplevel virtual meetings, and manage remote teams.[OLD]Step 6. Making Remote Work Productive"
121,Create a Task,"Select a Folder or Project from the left-hand Folder tree (this is where your task will be created).
Click the green plus sign in the Workspace's upper left-hand corner 1 and select ""Task"" 2.
Type a task name and press ""Enter"".
Your task is created and you can begin adding task attributes from the Task View 3 (assignee, due dates, and more) or right-click on a task from the List View to access quick edit options 4."
122,Assign a Task,"Choose the names of people to whom you want to assign a task, using the drop-down menu. Or you can type the first letters of the name, and Wrike will suggest an appropriate list of people. You can assign the task to as many people as you need. If the right name is not in the drop-down menu, you can invite that person to join Wrike and grant him or her a license. Read more about how to invite a user to Wrike.
When you create a task and assign it to a person, this person receives an automatic email notification. When the start date of the task comes, Wrike will remind the assignee about the task by including it in the interactive, daily to-do email list and by showing the task on his/her Dashboard. If the task is overdue, Wrike also will remind the responsible team member about it. Last, but not least, if somebody changes a task that you created, you will get an email notification about the change. The task changes history is shown in the comments under the task description.
When you assign someone to a task, the task is automatically shared with that person (if it was not shared with them before)."
123,Schedule a Task,"In the List view, you can set or change the start and due dates of a task by clicking on the calendar icon.
Alternatively, if you've clicked on the task to view its details, you can change the task dates by clicking the “Set date” button:
Set the start date 1 and due date 2 for your task and/or specify duration 3 in hours, minutes or days to build a more precise schedule.
The predefined date options — today and tomorrow 4 — support quick action choice. Click on them to set the date and close the date picker.
When you schedule a task, note that the “Working days only” option is checked by default 5, meaning that only all weekdays are counted when calculating the end date of a task, based on its duration and start date. If you do want weekends to be included into the calculation of the end date, please deselect the “Working days only” option.
Click on “Clear dates” option to deselect dates in “Start date” and “Due date” fields. 6
Users on Wrike for Professional Services accounts or Business and Enterprise accounts with the Wrike Resource add-on can enable effort for the task from the date picker. 7"
124,Tag a Task (Organize Tasks into Folders),"When you tag a task, you're adding it to a Folder or Project and you can add a task to multiple Folders or Projects. Tag tasks to better organize your workflow and to make it easier for your team to find tasks they need. There are a few ways to tag a task:
Drag the necessary Folder from the Folder tree onto a task.
Click the ""+"" button under a task's title in the Task View and then choose the appropriate Folder 1.
The task is added to the Folder (in addition to any Folders it was previously in) and shared with the people with whom this Folder is shared 2. The names of all Folders the task appears in are displayed under the task's name (like tags).  To tag multiple tasks at one time:
Switch to the List View.
Click ""Mass Edit"" at the top of the List View.
Click the checkmarks to the left of task names.
Drag a Folder or Project tag from the Folder tree onto the task list.
Wrike Tip! Use mass actions to tag or move multiple tasks at once."
125,Follow a Task,"Following a task is a great way to stay up-to-date with its changes and comments. If you follow a task, you see its updates in the Activity Stream and receive instant email notifications (if you have them enabled in your email notification settings).
You can easily start to follow or unfollow any particular task in your Workspace and invite other teammates to follow it. If you add a comment to a task or if you are mentioned after the @ symbol in a comment, you will automatically start following that task. Task authors and assignees also follow their tasks by default.
Add Someone as a Follower
Open a task.
Click the ""Follow"" button in the task's upper right-hand corner. 1
At the top of the panel, you'll see the avatars of the people who are currently following the task.
Click the ""+"" button. 2
Type the name of the person who should start following the task and choose their name from the list when it appears.
The person you added is now following the task and will get an email notification about the change."
126,Unfollow a Task,"To stop following a task:
Open a task.
Click the Follow button in the task's upper right-hand corner.
Click “Unfollow task”.
Please note, you will not be able to stop following a task if you are assigned to it. If you stop following a task you will not automatically stop following its subtasks, but you can repeat the above process for any subtasks you no longer want to follow.
To remove someone else from following a task: 
Open a task.
Click the Follow button 1 in the task's upper right-hand corner.
Hover over the person's avatar and click the 'x' that appears. 2
The person is no longer following the task and will receive an email notification telling them about the change."
127,Print a Task,"When you have a complicated task or want to discuss it at a face-to-face meeting, the hardcopy of the task containing its description and the activity stream might come in very handy.
Just open the task, click on the Menu button (the one with three dots) and choose ""Print"". A new browser tab will open with the standard print menu allowing you to print out the document or save it as a PDF or other preferred file type."
128,Add Dependencies to a Task,"Regular and External Users on all paid accounts can add dependencies to tasks.
To add dependencies to task 1, simply add a previous task 2, search for the next task 3, and choose the type of dependency 4.
You can also draw dependencies on the Gantt Chart."
129,Viewing Tasks,"If you want to (or need to) you can view a task in full screen. To do this, click on the Menu icon in the task's upper right hand corner and then choose ""Enter full screen.""
You can also choose to open the task in a different tab: click on the task's Menu button and then select ""Open task in separate tab""."
130,Overview,"Use the Task View to see task attributes. When you click on a task from the List View panel, the Task View opens as a panel to the right of the List View."
131,Navigate the Task View,
132,Overview,"Subtasks live within tasks and can help you divide your tasks into smaller action items. Subtasks have the same attributes as regular tasks so you can give each subtask their own due date, assignees, status, and more. There is no limit to the level of hierarchies you can have, which means that you can add subtasks to your subtasks.
Use subtasks to:
better track a task's progress. See what percentage of subtasks have been completed and use that information to understand how much work still needs to be done.
assign subtasks so that each team member (or team members) can mark their subtask complete without changing the statuses of their teammate’s tasks."
133,Important Information,"In some cases, Wrike asks if you want to align parent and subtask dates, but date alignment is optional, you can always schedule a subtask independently of the parent task’s scheduled dates and vice versa.
Automatically complete all of a task's active subtasks by completing a parent task and clicking ""Yes"" on the pop-up that appears 1. Cancel or defer all active subtasksinthe same way.
Subtasks must have scheduled start and end dates in order to appear on the Gantt Chart."
134,Create a Subtask,"Open the parent task where you would like to add a subtask.
Click the “Add subtask” button (or “+ New task"" if there are existing subtasks) from the Task View panel.
Enter a name for your subtask.
Press Enter on your keyboard.
Your subtask is instantly created and you can click on it to open it and begin editing it. A link to the subtask's parent task is located immediately above the subtask's title in the Task View."
135,View a Task's Subtasks,"On the List View
If a task has subtasks, you'll see an arrow to the left of a task's name. Click the arrow to expand or collapse the subtask list and see the names of all of the task’s subtasks. If a task doesn’t have any subtasks you will not see the subtask icon.
On the Task View
On the Task View, if a task doesn't have any subtasks then you will see the option to add a subtask near the top of the Task View. If a task does have subtasks, then you will see a field (near the top of the Task View) indicating the number of subtasks the task has. Click on the task's subtask field to expand or collapse the list of the task's subtasks.
On the Table View
You will see a plus sign to the left of a task (if it has subtasks). Click the plus sign to see that task’s subtasks or click the minus sign to the left of a task’s name to hide the task’s subtasks. If subtasks have their own set of subtasks you will see these same icons appear next to the parent subtask.
On the Gantt Chart
Tasks with subtasks have a ""+"" sign to the left of their name in the Gantt Chart. Click the plus sign to show the task’s subtasks on the timeline portion of the Gantt Chart. If a task's subtasks are displayed on the timeline, then you can click the ""-"" sign to the left of the parent task's name to hide the task’s subtasks.
On the Workload View
Subtasks and Tasks have the same appearance and features on the Workload View."
136,Edit Subtasks,"You can edit subtasks in the same way you would edit a regular task. When you open a subtask you will be able to add assignees, share the subtask, set start and due dates, and more. You can even give a subtask its own subtasks.

Click a subtask and drag it over to the task which is supposed to become its new parent task. The new parent task is highlighted light blue.
Release your mouse.
Your subtask now lives in the task you moved it to and no longer exists in the original parent task."
147,Reorder Subtasks on the List View,"Open the parent task where the subtasks live.
Drag-and-drop subtasks into the order you prefer."
148,Overview,"Subtasks and parent tasks can have unique start and end dates. However, as you reschedule subtasks and parent tasks Wrike asks if you want to align dates so that things stay in sync (you can always opt not to align dates).
Wrike asks if you want to align dates in two scenarios:
Expanding parent task dates. If you reschedule subtasks to before or after the parent task’s dates - Wrike asks if you want to expand the parent task dates to encompass its subtasks.*
Shifting task dates. If you reschedule a parent task (while keeping the duration the same) - Wrike asks if you want to reschedule subtasks as well.*
*These are the general rules, more details about the specific cases when you may be asked to align tasks are below."
149,Important Information,"You’ll be asked if you want to align dates if both the subtasks and parent task are active and are shared with you.
If tasks are linked by a dependency chain then you can reschedule the entire chain."
150,Expanding Parent Task Dates,"Wrike asks if you want to extend the parent task’s duration so that it encompasses the dates of all subtasks within it. The parent task will start on the same day as the earliest subtask and end on the final day of the last subtask. Wrike asks if you want to expand task dates if
You schedule a subtask and it now falls outside of the parent task’s dates.
You reschedule a parent task which has a subtask. After your rescheduling, the parent task dates do not encompass the subtask dates.
You have a parent task with multiple subtasks. One of the subtasks is outside of the parent task range. You reschedule any subtask. You’ll be asked if you want to align parent task dates.
A new (active) subtask is created in a parent task or an existing scheduled subtask is added to a parent task.
An existing scheduled subtask’s status is changed to an active status."
151,Shifting Task Dates,"When you reschedule a parent task, Wrike asks if you also want to reschedule its subtasks accordingly (have them be pushed forward or backward by the same number of days that the parent task was rescheduled by). Wrike asks to align subtasks if
You reschedule the parent task without changing its duration (you move it forward or back by any number of days)."
152,Exceptions,"There are some cases when Wrike does not ask if you want to align dates.
Expanding Parent Task Dates
Dependencies
If a parent task is part of any dependency chain, you will not be asked to expand parent task dates to align with subtask dates.
If you have subtasks with multiple parent tasks and any one of those is part of a dependency chain, none of the subtask’s parent tasks will expand.
Milestones
Milestones, by definition, can only be scheduled for a due date (one day). If tasks are rescheduled so that a subtask’s dates fall after the parent milestone’s date, you’ll be asked if you want to align tasks. In this case, the milestone is shifted so that it aligns with the latest due date of its subtasks.
Shifting Task Dates
Multiple Parent Tasks
If you have a subtask with multiple parent tasks then you may not see the task alignment option. If aligning the subtask with one parent task pushes it outside the scope of another parent task, then you won’t see the alignment option.
Dependencies 
Dependent task chains have their own alignment logic. If the task is linked to its subtasks via a dependency, then only normal dependency chain rules apply - task dates can shift but you will not be asked to align dates.
If the parent and subtask are not directly linked via a dependency chain, then you will be asked if you want to align dates. If the subtask is part of the dependency chain though, then aligning dates may remove dependencies."
153,Disable Alignment Pop-Up,"If you don't want to receive the pop-up asking if you want to align subtask and parent task dates you can disable the pop-up.

173,Overview,"There are seven different sorting options on the List view. Sort tasks by: priority, date, date modified, date created, status, importance or title."
174,Important Information,"By default, you only see tasks with an active status, but you can change the applied filters to see tasks with different statuses or which meet other available filter criteria.
To see tasks from descendant subfolders and subprojects: click the settings icon on the panel above the task list in the List View's upper right-hand corner and select it to show “Tasks from subfolders.” Note that this option is visible only when you have subfolders and subprojects in the folder, project, or space you are viewing."
175,Sorting Options,"Regular and External Users can drag and drop tasks to change their priority, Collaborators cannot. 
Priority is the default sorting setting for tasks in the List View. When sorting tasks by priority you can drag and drop tasks to change their priority: the closer a task is to the top of the list, the higher its priority.
All users who are shared on the folder or project will see tasks in the same order when they sort by priority. For example, if you change the order or tasks when sorting by priority, then the task list order is also changed for your teammates when they look at the folder or project and sort tasks by priority.
When sorting tasks by date, tasks are grouped into seven categories based on their scheduled dates: overdue, today, tomorrow, this week, next week, month, and later. The later category displays tasks whose start date is later than this month or which are backlogged (do not have scheduled start and end dates).
This option sorts tasks according to how long ago users made any changes to the task. Wrike takes into account:
Users making any changes in any of the task fields: task name, status, assignees, tags, description field, date, custom fields, sharing, approvals;
Users adding, editing or deleting task attachments;
Users adding, editing or deleting task comments.
The most recently modified tasks appear at the top of the list.
When you apply this option, tasks are sorted by the date of their creation. The most recently created tasks are at the top of the list whilst the oldest ones are closer to the bottom.
When you sort tasks by status, tasks fall into groups based on a status they have. Within groups, tasks are sorted alphanumerically.
Note about Custom Statuses. Business and Enterprise users can have Custom Statuses with the same name but from different Workflows. Because these are two separate statuses, tasks in these statuses are sorted into different groups.
When you sort tasks byimportance, tasks whose importance is set to “high” are listed first, followed by tasks with a “normal” importance, and then tasks with “low” importance are listed last.
Sort tasks by title to see a folder or project’s tasks listed alphanumerically."

231,Projects vs. Folders,"Quick details below, but check our page Building Blocks: Tasks, Folders, and Projects for more detailed information on when to use each item.
Use Spaces to group projects and folders together as one building block. For example, Spaces can contain projects, folders and tasks and that are related to each other. Spaces can include data related to your team, department, a specific project or whatever other organization processes.[OLD]Spaces Overview
Use folders to categorize work. For example, folders can be used to group projects and tasks by team, client, stage of work or however fits your team best. Folders can contain subfolders, projects, and tasks.
Use projects to manage a group of tasks that are part of a larger goal. With projects, you can track the status and due dates of the project separately from the individual tasks and can store files and notes that need to be accessible to the project team.
Tasks are the activities you need to complete. Tasks can be stand-alone activities or part of a larger project.
Finally, subtasks are the steps you need to take to complete a task. Subtasks are particularly useful if different people are responsible for each step.

271,Available Progress Metrics,"There are two metrics available for evaluating project progress. You can enable both of them or use each of them separately. Only active (enabled) metrics count towards total progress.
Metric
How it’s calculated
Example
Progress by number of completed tasks
The number of completed tasks is divided by the total number of tasks and the result is multiplied by 100%.
There are 10 tasks in your project.
Three of them are completed.
Progress by number is calculated as
(3 / 10) * 100% = 30%
Progress based on the duration of completed tasks
The duration of completedtasksis divided by the total duration oftasksin theprojectand the result is multiplied by 100%.
Note: If the duration of a project’s tasks is 0 days or not specified, this progress metric based on duration is calculated as 100%.
There are three tasks inside your project.
Their durations are 1, 2, and 5 days respectively.
The total duration of tasks is 1 + 2 + 5 = 8
Two-day task is completed.
Progress by duration is calculated as:
2 days (duration of completed tasks) / 8 days (total duration) * 100% = 25%
Total progress
All active (enabled) metrics are added up, and the result is divided by the number of active metrics.
Both metrics are enabled.
Progress by a number of tasks = 30%.
Progress by duration = 26%
Total progress is calculated as:
(30% (progress by number) + 26% (progress by duration)) / 2 = 28%"
272,,
273,Enable/Disable Progress Metrics,"In the Wrike workspace, all users, except for external users and collaborators, can enable/disable progress metrics, but this right may be disabled in theiraccess role.
Open the Progress panel.
Check (uncheck) the box to the left of the metric you want to enable (disable)."
274,Project Health Color-Coding,"Enable color-coding to make the progress bar and Progress panel header appear in the color that matches current progress. If a project’s progress color and status don’t match, Wrike suggests you change the status.
To enable color-coding:
Open the Progress panel.
Check the box to the left of “Project health.”
Projects can have four different colors depending on their progress:
Green: Isn’t overdue and has zero risks.
Amber: Isn’t overdue and has at least one risk but not all are risks.
Red: Is overdue or contains all risks.
Grey: Cancelled, completed, or on hold project status or dates are incorrect (e.g., its finish date is earlier than its start date).
Note: If color-coding is disabled or if the project doesn’t have a start or due date, the progress status bar is blue.
The deviation is more than 25%.
At least one task in a project is overdue.
The due date of at least one task in a project is later than the project’s finish date.
The deviation shows if your project is on track. A large deviation means that there’s a big difference between actual and planned progress.
We calculate deviation as:
Deviation = (1 - Actual Progress / Planned Progress) * 100%
Where
Planned progress is the number of days that have passed since the start of the project divided by the project duration.
Actual progress is progress calculated based on active metrics."
275,Project Risks,"The deviation is more than 25%.
At least one task in a project is overdue.
The due date of at least one task in a project is later than the project’s finish date."

Set up a due date for the created approval. Here you can enter number of days in which the approval process should be finished. If you need the task/project to be approved the same day the status is changed, enter 0 days into the field.
Select to finish the approval automatically when all approvers have given their decisions.
Set up automatic status change in case the task/project is approved or rejected.
Account with File Approvals can additionally select to add files for approval upon status change. You have 3 options:

Please note, the status changes only after the approval is finished.
Note that when you choose to start an approval upon status change together with requiring file selection, changing the status in any other view with exception of the Task view will create a draft approval only and won’t launch it. The user who started the approval and the approval assignee will receive an Inbox notification that a file needs to be added to the approval."

374,Important Information,"External Users and Collaborators cannot share Tasks, Folders, or Projects.[OLD]Types of Licenses[OLD]Types of Licenses
Regular Users with Editor or Limited Access cannot share Tasks, Folders, or Projects.
Check out our help center pages to learn how to share tasks, folders, and projects: Share Tasks, Folders, and Projects (Free and Professional) and Share Tasks, Folders, and Projects (Business and Enterprise). You automatically share a task with a user when you add them as an assignee or when you @mention them in a comment.
Sharing gives users access to an item, while following allows you (or other users) to receive notifications related to the Task, Folder, or Project. Learn how to follow Tasks, Folders, and Projects."
375,What Sharing Entails,"Once an item is shared with users:
They are able to access, view, and edit that item.

Regular Users with Full Access are able to share the item with other users."
376,"Private Tasks, Folders, and Projects","Projects and Folders created in the root folder are private by default and remain private until shared with someone or until added to another Project or Folder. If a Project or Folder is converted into a Subfolder, then it is automatically shared with all users who have access to the parent Folder/Project.
To create private tasks, first create a Folder or Project in the root folder and keep the Folder/Project unshared. Next, create tasks within that Folder or Project. Tasks created in this Folder or Project remain private until you share them with someone or until you add them to another Task, Folder, or Project. If you add a private task to another item, then the task is automatically shared with all users who have access to the parent Task, Folder, or Project.
Please note, if you add a task to your private Folder or Project, and that task is shared with other users, then it remains shared with those users even after it is added to your private Folder."

When you turn on Selective Sharing, the folder/project is no longer automatically shared with additional users when you:
Share the parent folder/project with additional users.
Add the folder/project to another folder/project, or move the folder/project from one folder/project to another.
Please note,any subfolders or subprojects added to the folder/project with Selective Sharing turned on will follow the logic of Inherited Sharing — unless these new subfolders/subprojects also have Selective Sharing turned on."

414,Possible Formulas & Resulting Data Types,"You can add different types of fields to one formula, but the calculated result can only have one type. Let’s say we need to calculate the total payment for an employee who charges per hour:
Formula example: [Hourly Rate]*[Time Spent]=”Currency”
The field [Hourly Rate] has the “Currency” data type, and the field [Time Spent] is set as “Hours.” The resulting field type of this calculation will be “Currency.”
The table below shows which types of fields can be included in formulas together, which math operation can be applied to them, and what the resulting data type will be.
To find out what the result of your formula will be:
If we take formula from the example above: [Hourly Rate]*[Time Spent]=”Currency”.
[Hourly Rate] has the “Currency” data type, and [Time Spent] is set as “Hours.” So, we multiply ""Currency"" by ""Hours"".
1 Choose the data type of the first field in the formula from the first column on the left.
2 Underneath it, choose the line with the required math operation.
3 Following the line, slide to the right until you reach the column with the data type of the second part of the formula.
Note: The order of fields in the formula is important for the resulting type of data. For example, if you divide “Number” by “Hours,” the resulting type will be “Number.” But if you switch the fields in the formula and divide “Hours” by “Number,” the result will be “Hours.”

415,Color-Code Calculation Results,"Color-coding allows you to add green-, amber-, and red-colored markers to the result of the calculation. The markers appear on Table view in the calculated field’s column next to the result. This allows you to quickly view which of your projects you need to pay attention to.
Let’s say we need to see which of our projects are outside of the budget limit and by what percentage. So, we divide the actual [Expenses] by [Estimated Budget] and change the resulting type of data from ""Number"" to ""Percentage"", as described in Step 3 of writing a formula.
Formula example: [Expences]/[Estimated Budget]=""Percentage""
To color-code the calculation results:
While creating or editing the calculated custom field, check the box next to “Show conditional marker.” 1 *
In the opened window, click “+ Add another rule.”
Select a condition from the drop-down list. 2
Select a color for the marker that will be shown if the condition you set in the previous step is true. 3
Repeat Steps 2 to 4 to set up as many markers as you need.
Click “Create” if you are creating the calculated custom field or “Save” if you are editing it. 4
When you get back to the Table view, you will need to add the newly created field to the view. For that, click on the gear icon in the upper-left corner of the table and check the box next to the calculated field. After that, you'll see the field and colored markers next to the calculation results in the Table view.
*The name of the checkbox will be displayed as ""Add conditional coloring"" if the result of the calculation is set as ""Percentage"" and the ""Show progress bar"" checkbox is checked."

447,Roll Up Custom Field Data,"Regular users can enable custom field data rollup for projects and folders.
You can roll up data from the Number, Percentage, Currency, and Duration custom fields in the project/folder info panel and Table view.
When you enable custom field data rollup:
Wrike takes all values of this custom field from the subprojects/subfolders*, tasks, and subtasks within the project or folder; automatically calculates the sum or an average; and enters the result in the project’s or folder's custom field.
Wrike calculates the rolled up value for the project/folder as sum or average according to the default aggregation set for this custom field.
If you or other users manually entered a value for this custom field in the project/folder before, it’ll be cleared and replaced with the rolled up value.
The project/folder’s custom field will not be editable until you disable the data rollup.
*Values from subprojects are taken into account only if they were entered manually. If the subproject’s custom field value was also rolled up, it won’t be counted.
To roll up custom field data for a project/folder:
Select a project/folder from the left-hand Navigation panel.
Open the project/folder’s info panel.
Hover over the custom field you want to roll up the data for.
Click on the “Aggregate values from children”
icon*.
The rolled up value is automatically entered in the custom field of the project/folder. To disable data rollup for this project/folder, simply click on the icon from Step 4 again and the custom field will become editable.
*If you do not see the rollup icon, that means this custom field’s default aggregation is set as “None.” You need to change it to “Sum” or “Average.”
To enable or disable data rollup for multiple projects:
In the left-hand Navigation panel, select a folder, project, or Space that contains all projects you want to enable or disable the rollup for.
Switch to the Table view.
Click the caret icon next to the name of the field you’d like to roll up.
In the menu that appears, hover over ""Roll up.""*
Select “Enable/Disable for all projects.”
Confirm your decision in the pop-up that appears.
*If you don’t see this option, that means this custom field’s default aggregation is set as “None.” You need to change it to “Sum” or “Average.”
Values in this field are immediately rolled up for all projects that are currently on the view. Or, if you choose to disable, the rollup is disabled and the custom field becomes editable.
Wrike Tip! Rollup is also available for project dates."
448,Aggregate and Sort Custom Field Data,"Aggregating data allows you to automatically run calculations for custom fields* with numeric values (all text entries are omitted). There are two types of aggregation:
Sum — Wrike automatically sums up all numeric entries and displays the total.
Average — all entered values are added together and then divided by the total number of entries.
To use the aggregation feature on the Table view:
From within the Table view, find the custom field with the data you would like to aggregate and click the carrot icon which appears to the right of the field’s name.
Hover over “Aggregation”.

In the pop-up that appears scroll to the “Default Aggregation” field.

Sort Data
Need to sort tasks depending on their priority tag in custom fields? To sort data:

Click on the field’s name or the arrow icon which appears next to the field’s name.
Click the field’s name again to change the sorting."
449,Custom Field Data Rollup vs. Data Aggregation,"The purpose of data rollup is to automatically fill in a project’s custom field based on the custom field values of its tasks and subtasks. The purpose of aggregation is to calculate the sum or average of all custom field values for all projects, tasks, and subtasks that you add on the Table view currently.
Data rollup automatically calculates custom field values of tasks and subtasks within a project and sets the result of the calculation as the project’s custom field value. Data aggregation calculates the custom field values and displays them on the Table view.
Data rollup can be enabled in the project’s info panel and the Table view. Data aggregation is only enabled on the Table view.
Data rollup’s type cannot be changed from the Table view because it depends on the custom field’s setting; you need to edit the custom field and change the default aggregation type. On the other hand, with data aggregation, you can change the type to “Sum”, “Average,” or “None” right on the Table view."
450,Arrange Custom Fields on the Table View,"On the Table view, each custom field appears in its own column and you can rearrange the order which columns appear in. To do this:
Click on a column's title.
Drag the column to the place where you would like it to appear and then release the mouse button."
451,Hide Custom Fields,"Hide a custom field when you no longer need to see it for that folder, project or Space. When you hide a field, it remains available to add back at any point. Field data is preserved so that, if you do add a field back, data for associated tasks, folders and projects, is added back as well.

467,Overview,"Task statuses reflect the typical states a task can be in over its lifecycle. Workflows in Wrike are made up of a set of statuses, and each workflow is made up of four groups: active, completed, deferred, and cancelled. The default workflow is available to all Wrike users and there is one status in each of the four groups.
Business and Enterprise accounts: In addition to the default workflow these accounts can create Custom Workflows and Statuses and specify who should be added as an assignee if a task has a particular status. Create a new workflow to meet a team’s needs, and add statuses within that workflow which reflect the typical statuses your tasks go through.
For more information on how to automate statuses and workflows, check our Advanced Custom Workflows page."
468,Important Information,"All new tasks are created as active by default. If a Custom Workflow is applied, then tasks are given the first status in the active group of the Custom Workflow.
Deferred and cancelled tasks do not show up on task to-do emails or on overdue widgets on your Dashboard.
A task can only have one status at a time.
For Business and Enterprise Accounts
All users on Business and Enterprise accounts can use Custom Workflows and Statuses, but workflows can only be created or edited by an account admin.
Each Business and Enterprise account can have a maximum of 200 workflows but there is no limit to the number of statuses that you can have within a workflow.

479,Fixed and Flexible Workflows,"Fixed and flexible workflows are available on Business and Enterprise accounts.
Fixed Workflows
When changing a task’s status, users can only choose from certain predesignated statuses. Admins determine which status should have predetermined follow-up statuses and they choose what the follow-up statuses are.
For example, if a task is “In Progress”, users will only be able to change the task to “In Review” or “Completed”. They will not see or be able to select any other status options.
Wrike Tip! Account admins can override restrictions of fixed workflows, but this applies only in Task view. To apply this setting, the “Change status and workflow regardless of workflow restrictions” permission must be enabled for it within the Account Management section.
Flexible Workflows
When changing a task’s status, users see specifically predesignated status options, all other statuses are accessible under a “More” menu option. Admins determine which status should have predetermined follow-up statuses and they choose what the follow-up statuses are.
For example, if a task is “In Progress”, users see “In Review” or “Completed” as options but they are able to select other statuses under a “More” navigation menu."

** This option is available in all accounts when create/duplicate tasks is selected. It is also available for creating/duplicating projects in accounts with project custom workflows. If you do not select a status, tasks created via request submission will have the first active status of the workflow applied to the folder, project or Space where they are created.
Step 3: Add Questions
Click “+ Question”. 6
Choose the type of field (question) you want to add: short answer, paragraph, dropdown, checkboxes, number, date, file attachments, or importance*.

Set up branching to make your request form dynamic.
Use the ""Helper text"" field to add additional information about the question (optional). This information is visible to requesters but won't appear on the resulting task or Project.
*The importance field is only available for task Requests not Project Requests.
Step 4: Publish or Save the Request Form
Click “Publish” to publish the Request and make it available in the Workspace. Once a Request is published all users who the Request is shared with can see it in the Workspace.
Click “Save” to save the Request as it is but keep it private. Only admins can see Requests that are saved in a draft stage, they are not visible in the Workspace.
All published and saved Requests are visible to admins on the “Request forms” tab of Account Management."

496,"Duplicate Existing Tasks, Projects, or Blueprints from a Request","When you set a request form to duplicate a project/task:
A duplicate of the selected project, task or blueprint is created in the workspace each time someone uses the form to submit a request.
Tasks in the new project or subtasks of the new task created upon form submission have the same assignees, descriptions and attachments as the original tasks/subtasks.
To set up your request form to duplicate tasks, projects or blueprints:
Under “Actions upon submission” section, select “Duplicate Task” or “Duplicate Project”. 1
A pop-up will appear, where you can select the existing task or project that will be duplicated. 2
Start typing the name of the required task/project and click on it.
Click on the Blueprint tab 3 to select a blueprint to duplicate.
Admins creating the request form can also choose to reschedule tasks/subtasks in the newly created project/task. The available options are:
Don't reschedule - makes the task dates identical to the scheduled dates in the original project, task, or blueprint.
Align with project/task start date - the first task/subtask starts on the same date as the project/parent task.*
Align with project/task end date - the last task/subtask ends on the project's/parent task's end date.*
* If you choose to align dates with project or parent task dates, then the request form must contain a question that is mapped with a corresponding date.
Add a Prefix You can set a prefix for tasks and projects duplicated via a request. The prefix will be applied to all associated subfolders, subprojects, tasks, and subtasks, upon submission.
Click your profile image in the upper right-hand corner of your Workspace.
Select ""Settings"" from the dropdown.
Click ""Request forms"" in the left panel and click on the request form you want to add a prefix to.
Under “Actions upon submission”, select ""Duplicate Project""/”Duplicate Task”. 1
Click ""Add a prefix for all tasks and subfolders"". 2
Choose ""Select a question"" and select one question from the Request form. 3
When someone submits the form, the answer they provide to the question designated for setting the prefix is added to the title of the newly created task or, if it’s a Project, to its title and all items within. Please note, Request submitters must answer the question in order for a prefix to be added."
497,Form Builder: Response Mapping Options,"When you map responses, you're telling Wrike where in the task/Project an answer should be displayed. For example, if you add a short answer field and map it to the title, then responses in that field are used as the task or Project's title.

Important notes:
If nothing is mapped to the title then the title is: the task or Project id followed by the Request form's name. For example, a task submitted using the Marketing Request form would be: 58672: Marketing Request.
If multiple responses are mapped to the title, then responses are separated by a “-” in the title.
*In order to map to a Custom Field, the following must be true: 1) A Folder/Project for items to be created in must be specified in the right-hand panel in the ""Place task/Project into"" field 2) the Custom Field you want to map to exists on that Folder/Project."
498,Form Builder: Available Question Types,"There are seven available field types which you can add to your Request
Short answer: one line response field.
Paragraph: multi-line response field.
Dropdown: dropdown list, users can select one option from the list.

10 Signs You're Making the Most of Wrike"
500,Overview,"Wrike requests consist of two parts: (1) the Request Form Builder which admins can use to create and edit request forms and (2) submission forms. This page covers the form submission process in detail, for information on submitting forms see our Create a request (for admins) page or create an external request.
When you submit a request, Wrike automatically
Creates a task or project. (Admins specify which item type should be created when setting up the form).
Populates the task or project with information from the request form fields.
Adds the task or project to a location in the folder tree.
Assigns the task to the designated user(s) or adds an owner to the project (if it was specified by the request creator)."
501,Important Information,"Admins can view all saved or published requests from the Requests tab of the Account Management section.
You can have branded external request forms. The same logo used for a branded workspace is used on external request forms.
If there are more than 5 request forms in your account, they will be automatically separated into three sections:
Recently used: up to 5 of the latest forms submitted by you in the last month.
Recommended: up to 5 forms most frequently submitted by other users in the account in the last month.
All: the full list of request forms available to you in the account."
502,Use Cases,"For process owners: requests help simplify your intake workflow and add structure to the request system. For users submitting requests: requests bring clarity to the request process, ensure that requests are added to the appropriate location, and decrease the chances that requests are lost.
Below are a few examples on how requests can help your team, but if you want more specific suggestions, check out our blog post: 10 Request Form Templates to Help Your Team Succeed.
For Marketing: create requests for creative materials, blog posts, or one pagers.
For IT: create requests for new hardware, to report software problems, or to ask for access to company software.
For Human Resources: create requests for new hire desk setup, new job postings, or candidate referrals.
For Developers: create requests for bug reports, new product features, or technical help.
Want more information? Watch a short video on how requests can help your workflow."

Users within your account can also use the request (unless you choose not to make it visible to them).
Anyone with a link to the request form can fill it out and submit it.
A unique HTML-code snippet for the created form is generated which can be copied and pasted into one of your website pages, thus embedding the form. This will allow your website visitors to see and submit the form directly from the site."
505,Important Information,"You can have branded external request forms. The same logo used for a branded workspace is used on external request forms.
Anyone who fills out a request via the link is required to pass CAPTCHA verification.
When someone submits a request form they receive an email confirmation letting them know that their request was successfully submitted.
Requests filled out by non-Wrike users are added to the folder/project designated for that request and their name and email are listed at the top of the resulting task or project."
506,Make a Request Form Available Externally,"Create a request form or open an existing one.
Check the ""Enable public link"" box in the upper right-hand corner.

Uncheck the ""Add CAPTCHA"" box if you don't want to have CAPTCHA on the form. Note, that disabling this option puts you at risk of spam.
Click ""Publish"" (for newly created forms) or ""Save"" (for existing forms).
You'll see a pop-up with two tabs. The first one contains a link to the request and you can click the arrow icon to either a) open it in a new browser tab for testing, or b) see how the form will look for an external submitter. The second tab of the pop-up contains the iFrame HTML-code that you can use to embed the form into your website."

673,Important Information,When you reschedule a task with dependencies all dependent tasks are automatically rescheduled.
674,Types of Dependencies,"There are four types of dependencies you can create in Wrike:
Dependency
Function
Finish to Start
Task B can't start before Task A is finished.
Start to Start
Task B can't start before Task A starts.
Finish to Finish
Task B can't finish before Task A is finished.
Start to Finish
Task B can't finish before Task A starts."

Locate a task in the table and double-click on the ""Predecessors"" column. If you don't see the column: click the gear icon in the table's upper left-hand corner and check the box next to ""Predecessors"".
Find the task which should precede the task from Step 1.
In the task from Step 1, enter the row number from Step 2's task followed by one of the below
FS - to create a Finish to Start dependency.
SS - to create a Start to Start dependency.
FF - to create a Finish to Finish dependency.
SF - to create a Start to Finish dependency.
If you only enter a number then a Finish to Start dependency is created by default.
4. Press enter on your keyboard.
Create on the Timeline
Hover over a task bar.
Click the dot that appears to the left or right of the taskbar.
Drag your mouse to the beginning or end of the task you want to create a dependency with.
Release the mouse button to create the dependency.
Milestones in Dependency Chains
You can add milestone tasks to the dependency chains. However, they do not shift when the tasks in the dependency chain get rescheduled. A scheduling conflict occurs and the dependency arrow turns red if:
The predecessor task in a Finish to Start type of dependency is set to finish later than the milestone date.
The successor task in a Start to Finish dependency starts earlier than the milestone date.
The parallel task in a Start to Start type of dependency is set to finish later than the milestone date.
You can reschedule the entire dependency chain including the milestone task. Learn how to do that below."
676,Shift a Dependency Chain,"If you have a chain of dependent tasks, then you can mass reschedule them on the Gantt Chart. Gaps between tasks are preserved when you reschedule tasks in this way.
Create a chain of tasks joined by dependencies.
Press and hold ""Shift"" on your keyboard.
Click a task that's part of a dependency chain on the Gantt Chart.

SF - to create a Start to Finish dependency.
If you only enter a number then a Finish to Start dependency is created by default."
679,Lead and Lag Time,"Specify:
Lead time 1 to indicate the overlap between tasks (i.e. to designate that the next task(s) in a chain can start N days before its predecessor has finished).
Lag time 2 to indicate the wait period before the next task(s) in a chain can start.
Note! You can specify lead/lag time only from the table portion of the Gantt Chart. When you drag and drop a task on the timeline, lead/lag isn't automatically added.
From the Table:
Locate a task for which you need to indicate lag time (a wait period).

680,Overview,The Gantt Chart has a default sorting order but you can also customize how tasks are sorted to meet your (and your team’s) needs.
681,Sorting on the Gantt Chart,"By default, cascade sorting is applied to Tasks, Folders, and Projects. A Task, Folder, or Project’s vertical position on the Gantt Chart (how close or far it is from the top of the screen) is determined by the following rules of cascade sorting:
Projects are sorted by their dates: Projects with the earliest start date are displayed closer to the top of the chart than other Folders and Projects.
Folders are sorted by the start date of their earliest task. Folders containing Tasks with earlier start dates are listed closer to the top of the screen than other Folders and Projects.
Projects without dates and Folders without tasks are sorted alphanumerically and are listed underneath all other Projects and Folders.
Subfolders and Subprojects are listed directly underneath their parent Folder or Project.
Within a Folder or Project, tasks with dependencies are listed first and then tasks are listed based on their start dates.
If more than one task has the same start date, then the task with the shorter duration is listed first. If there are multiple tasks (or dependency chains containing tasks) with the same start date and duration, then they are sorted alphanumerically."
682,Change Sorting Order,"Click the column title to apply ascending sorting by values in this column; click the same title again to apply descending sorting.
Click “Cascade sorting” above the timeline to go back to cascade sorting.
Note, that it’s not possible to sort by the “Predecessor” column."
683,Manually Reorder Tasks on the Gantt Chart,"Tasks on the timeline mimic the order of tasks on the table. When you rearrange tasks on the table, tasks on the timeline side shift to match the new order and vice versa.
Rearrange Tasks from the Timeline
Click and hold a task bar on the timeline.
Move the task to the appropriate location.
Release your mouse.
Rearrange Tasks From the Table
Click and hold a task's row number from the table side of the view.
Move the task to the appropriate location on the table.
Release your mouse.
Wrike Tip! To select a range of tasks: click in the first task's row, press and hold Shift on your keyboard, and click in the row of the last task you want selected. Once the range is selected, you can drag and drop it the same way you do with a single task."
684,Overview,"Print the timeline portion of the Gantt Chart to generate a pdf file which you can save, view, share, and print."
685,Important Information,"If a task is not visible or shown on the timeline, then it won’t be visible when you print the timeline.
If a Folder or Project is collapsed on the timeline, then its tasks are not visible when you print the timeline.
Use filters to adjust which tasks are visible on a timeline.

Note that you can also double click on the timeline to zoom in and ctrl + double-click (alt + double-click for Mac users) to zoom out."
689,Overview,"By default, start and end dates for all items within Wrike are completely independent. For example, if you have a Task with Subtasks - the Task and its Subtasks can have different dates (they are not automatically aligned). The same holds true for Project dates and the dates of Tasks within it.
From the Gantt Chart you can roll up dates. Rolling up dates means that: a top-level item’s dates are based on the dates of items within it. When you roll up dates
Start date: earliest date that an item within it starts
Due date: latest date that an item within it ends"
690,Important Information,"When rolling up dates, Wrike only takes visible items into account (i.e. items that are hidden by filters are not taken into account).
If you roll up dates for a top-level item and no item within it has scheduled dates, then the top-levels dates are cleared.
If the feature is enabled, the bracket will be displayed with the project’s own dates as a bold filling, whilst the part representing dates of tasks which fall outside this timeframe will have no filling on the timeline, just an outline. This way you can see actual dates of the project and dates for which tasks in this project are scheduled."
691,Enable Date Roll Up from Labs,"Date roll up is available for Regular and External Users on all paid accounts. Enable it for your individual account.
Visit Wrike Labs.
Scroll to “Roll up dates on the Gantt Chart”.
Check the box next to ""Enable"".
You can now roll up dates on the Gantt Chart in your Workspace."
692,Roll Up Dates,"To roll up an item's dates:
Open a Folder or Project and switch to the Gantt Chart.
In the table portion of the Gantt Chart right-click the parent Task or Project whose dates you want to roll up.
Select “Item Roll up”.
The parent Task or Project’s dates change and are rolled up from the items within it.
To roll up dates for all items within a branch*:
Open a Folder or Project and switch to the Gantt Chart.
In the table portion of the Gantt Chart right-click a parent Task or Project.
Select “Branch Roll up”.
Wrike starts rolling up dates starting from the bottom up. Dates are progressively rolled up for items higher up in the branch until the dates on the parent Task or Project selected in step 2 are rolled up.
*A branch includes all items nested within one item. For example, a Project could have Tasks, Subtasks, Subprojects, etc."
693,Overview,"Date constraints signal the earliest date that a task can begin. Once a date constraint is in place, the task cannot be automatically rescheduled to a date prior to that indicated by this constraint. For example, if you create a finish to start dependency and then reschedule the first task to an earlier date, then:
if there is no date constraint, the dependent task is automatically rescheduled to begin immediately after the first task.
if there is a date constraint, the dependent task is rescheduled to begin as early as the date of the date constraint, but not before it.
On the Gantt Chart, date constraints appear as solid vertical lines at the beginning of a dependent task."
694,Important Information,"If a task has a date constraint, and you delete the dependency, then the date constraint automatically reappears when you recreate the dependency."
695,Date Constraints on the Table,"You can add, remove, and edit date constraints on the table portion of the Gantt Chart.

699,Overview,"Gantt Chart Snapshots create a static record of what the Gantt Chart looks like at that moment for a folder or project. When you create a Snapshot, a link is generated and saved in Wrike. Sharing the link to a Gantt Chart Snapshot allows others to view a project’s current timeline.
Snapshots show the folder's or project’s:
Subtasks and tasks (only those with scheduled dates appear on the timeline portion of the Snapshot). The Snapshot automatically includes the tasks' titles, statuses, scheduled dates, and dependencies, and you have the option to include task assignees on the Snapshot as well.
Any subfolders or subprojects (and their tasks) in the folder or project.
From a Snapshot you can:

709,Overview,"Critical Path shows a task or tasks which can cause your project to fall behind (i.e. if a task on the Critical Path is delayed then you can/will miss your Project due date). On the timeline portion of the Gantt Chart, all tasks which are part of the Critical Path turn red, tasks not on the Critical Path remain their original color.
Use Critical Path to:
Focus on the tasks which are crucial to the project’s completion.
See what tasks can be rescheduled without affecting the project’s deadlines.
Critical Paths highlight:
The latest scheduled task in a Folder(s)/Project(s).
If the latest scheduled task is linked to other tasks via dependencies, then any task where even a 1-day delay would push out the final task’s end date is also highlighted in red."
710,View Critical Paths,"Select a Folder or Project from the Folder tree.
Switch to the Gantt Chart.
Click the Critical Path icon in the upper left-hand corner.
Any task where a delay would push out the project deadline turns red."
711,Examples,"1: One Task Critical Path (Space Between Tasks)
On the Critical Path: Task J.
Here’s why:
If Task J’s due date changes, then the Project’s finish date changes as well. Even a 1 day delay to Task J would push out the Project’s finish date, therefore it’s a part of the Critical Path.
Tasks I and H aren’t included in the Critical Path because there’s a gap between their due dates and Task J’s start date (i.e. tasks I and H could have some delay without affecting Task J).
2: Two Task Critical Path (No Space Between Tasks)
On the Critical Path: Tasks H and J.
Here’s why:
Task H now ends immediately prior to Task J (there’s no gap between them). Task H is also connected to Task J via a finish to start dependency. That means that if Task H is pushed out, Task J will be too, and Task’s J’s finish date impacts the Project’s finish date.
3: Multiple Task Critical Path (Multiple Dependencies)
On the Critical Path: Tasks A, E, H, and J
Here’s why:
Task E’s due date is now the day before Task H’s start date (there’s no gap between tasks). Task A’s due date is the day before Task E’s start date (there’s no gap between them).
If either Task A, E, or H are delayed by one day then Task J is delayed and the Project’s end date is pushed out as well."

If you select multiple cells with different values and no sequence (text, dropdown, checkboxes), these values are populated in a cycle throughout the column.
Note that some fields (Task ID, Creation date, Task author, Billing type) can't be edited.
Wrike Tip! You can copy any value from a cell (or cells) and paste it to another cell in the table. Use keyboard shortcuts for that (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V on Windows and Cmd+C, Cmd+V on Mac). Note that the format of these cells value should be the same."

797,Overview,"Wrike Analyze is an add-on that allows you to see Wrike workspace data in interactive analytics boards. You can create boards and widgets using the pre-built templates, or start from scratch and create a custom analytics board.
Charts are automatically updated with the most recent data once a day, so you don’t have to worry about recreating reports or pulling new information."
798,Important Information,"Information displayed in an analytics board corresponds to a snapshot of Wrike workspace data, which is made daily after 8 p.m. in the timezone of the account owner. You can see the actual time of the snapshot within the top bar of an analytics board.
You can't create analytics boards based on folders, projects, or spaces created less than 24 hours ago.
The “Include data from” filter always needs to be populated to avoid errors and incorrect results in widgets.
Custom fields that are not shared with everyone in the account are unavailable in analytics.
Custom fields that are not numeric/currency/percentage cannot be added as columns to Pivot widgets
There is no way to filter an analytics board using two different custom fields at once. To filter over a single custom field, select two filters: with custom field name and required value(s). You can create two different widgets, each filtering for a specific custom field.
Wrike Analyze is not available on accounts encrypted with Wrike Lock.
For the best performance, it's recommended to have no more than 8 widgets per board.
Project/Task Status labels and colors might be distorted when exporting to PDF. We recommend setting the colors manually for each status in widget settings."
799,Available Data,"Analytic boards are built over a data model that contains key Wrike workspace entities and building blocks, such as Spaces, folders, tasks, timelogs, users and history of status changes.
You can visualize or filter any attribute of any entity. Entities are already connected to each other behind the scenes, so you can build boards that span multiple entities, without specifying relations between entities.
To see the whole list of data available in our Wrike Analyze data model go to the Wrike Analyze: Available Data Help center page."
800,Available Analytics Widgets,"Pivot: This one might be the most useful for summarizing and analyzing large amounts of data.
Pie Chart: Use Pie Chart to display proportional data, and/or percentages.
Column Chart: The Column Chart can be used for comparing items and comparing data over time. The chart can include multiple values on both the X and Y-axis.
Bar Chart: Use Bar Chart to compare many items. You can see descriptive data (e.g. categories or items) along the Y-Axis and values displayed on the X-Axis.
Line Chart: Use Line Chart to compare changes over the same period of time for more than one group or category.
Area Chart: This one is very similar to the Line Chart except that the areas under each line are colored, and it is possible to display them as stacked.
Table: Table widget displays a broader view of your data, presenting it in columns.
Tree Map: The Tree Map is a multi-dimensional widget that displays hierarchical data in the form of nested rectangles.
Scatter Map: Use Scatter Maps to visualize geographical data as data points on a map. The map distinguishes data using different colors and sizes for the data points on the map.
Area Map: Area Map shows the locations of data, selected for the widget.
Indicator: The Indicator widget provides various options for displaying one or two numeric values as a number, gauge or ticker. It also provides the option to add additional titles and a color-coded indicator icon representing the value.
Scatter Chart: The Scatter Chart displays the distribution of two variables on an X-Axis, Y-Axis, and two additional dimensions of data that are shown as colored circles scattered across the chart.
Calendar Heatmap: Use the Calendar Heatmap widget to visualize values over days in a calendar-like view.
Sunburst: The Sunburst widget is similar to a Pie Chart but is multi-dimensional. Whereas a pie chart combines one field and one numeric value, the Sunburst widget can display multiple rings, one for each field.
Box & Whisker Plot: Box Plots are divided into four quartiles. The middle quartiles are represented by a box that contains 50% of the data and the median value. The upper and lower quartiles contain the maximum and minimum values and the remaining 50% of the data. These quartiles are represented by lines called whiskers.
Polar Chart: Use the Polar Chart to compare multiple categories/variables with a spacial perspective.
Funnel Chart: Funnel Chart is a common way to show stages in a process, with the most prevalent example being a funnel representing stages in a sales process."

813,Overview,"Formulas are custom calculations performed on one or more fields in your data. They offer an important way to analyze results and express business logic. Using formulas in your widgets helps you to build expressions on various fields from various objects in your data, for example:
Count tasks, projects or other objects, total or under certain condition
Sum timelogs, custom fields and other data
Reference custom fields
Calculate date or numeric field differences
Calculate averages
Perform complex business calculations
Refer only to data matching specific criteria and conditions
All formulas in Wrike Analyze widgets must return numeric values. You can reference any non-numeric data, but the outcome will still be numeric. For example, you can calculate the difference between Project Start Date and Due Date (duration), but it will be expressed as a number, e.g. number of days.

814,Using Formulas in Widgets,"You can create and use formulas when adding a widget to your analytics board. To access the formula editor click “+Select data” and then click the formula icon.
The Formula Editor has two tabs - the Data Browser to select fields and the Functions tab to select formula operations. You can create a formula combining one or more function, field and filter(s).
Functions are operations which perform different calculations, for example: a sum. Use the ‘Jump To’ menu or the search box to quickly find the formula you need.
Fields in the Data Browser are variables contained in the data set. Clicking on a field in the data browser will include it as part of the formula.
Filters can be applied to restrict formulas based on criteria.
To create a widget based on a formula:
While editing an analytics board, click “+Widget”.
Click the ""+Custom widget"" button.
Click the plus button next to ""Values.""
In the window that opens, click the ""fx"" button..

Type in the required parts of the formula. You can see some examples of formula use here.
Click “Ok” to save the formula and create a widget."
815,Creating Formulas Based on Criteria and Conditions (Filters),"Often formulas must take into account specific criteria. To do this Wrike Analyze provides a feature called Measured Value, which is similar to the SUMIF function in Excel, and performs a calculation only when the values meet a set of criteria.
Criteria for Measured Values may be based on any logical operators in a filter.
To filter the formula:
In the Data Browser, create your formula from the Data Browser and Functions, as explained in Using Formulas In Widgets.
Add the field (criteria) by which you want to filter the formula. Right-click the field and select Filter. You can filter the formula by listed items, text options, ranking, etc.
When done, click OK."
816,Using Formulas to Reference Custom Fields,"A common example of Measured Value is referencing a custom field, for example to sum a custom field for all projects, or to display it as column in a Pivot table.
To reference a custom field, you can create a formula that sums custom field value with a filter over custom field name.
To create formula that sums or references specific custom field:

817,Overview,"Analytics boards in Wrike Analyze are built over a data model which contains key Wrike workspace entities and building blocks, such as Spaces, folders, tasks, timelogs, users and history of status changes.
You can visualize or filter any attribute of any entity. Entities are already connected to each other behind the scenes, so you can build boards that span multiple entities, without specifying relations between entities.

A new date picker with task effort
Effort field in the Table view, Gantt chart, and Reports
Workload charts
Job roles
Timesheets
Billable time tracking and locking time entries
Team utilization report"
830,Get Started with Wrike Resource,"Step 1. Specify effort on all tasks which require actual effort to complete.
There are a few different ways to do that, so choose the one which fits you best.
Step 2. Create and assign job roles to your employees. And assign tasks to job roles to define which talent you’ll require to finish them.
Step 3. Create a Workload chart for each team whose capacity you need to manage.
A Workload chart shows all scheduled tasks with effort assigned to your team members on a timeline. You can create, reschedule, and reassign tasks, edit their effort directly from the chart, and group them according to the project that they are in.
Step 4. Configure a Backlog box for your Workload charts.
The Backlog box is a place for tasks that are waiting to be assigned or scheduled. You can configure it based on different task attributes, for example, you can choose to show only tasks with a specific status.
Step 5. Share Workload charts with your teammates.
After the Workload chart is created and configured, you can share it with your teammates. If needed, you can set up access roles for users and user groups that you are sharing the chart with.
Note that when you share a Workload chart the folders, on which it is based, are not automatically shared with the user or group.
Step 6. Track your working hours using Timesheets
Timesheets help employees see and track all the work they’ve done for the week. And billable time setting automatically marks working time entries as billable or non-billable. Users can also review others’ Timesheets and lock time entries on the Timelog view to prevent them from being edited.
Step 7. Check team utilization
With the Team utilization report template, you get an overview of how well your employees’ capacity is utilized and what percentage of their time is spent on billable tasks."
831,Overview,"Use Workload charts to manage your team members’ capacity, prioritize tasks based on their capacity, and plan work allocation.
An essential part of the Workload charts is Backlog Box, which contains tasks that you can assign to users on a Workload chart. Please visit the Backlog Box page to learn more about it.
This page contains an overview of Workload charts, how to use them, and how to set them up. To learn more about working with tasks on the Workload charts, please visit the Manage Tasks on Workload Charts page."
832,Important Information,Only scheduled assigned tasks appear on Workload charts.
833,How to Use Workload Charts,"Workload charts display tasks from the location you select when you create a chart. Your team members’ capacity is affected only by the tasks that have effort, so choose one of the following options that works best for you:
Build a chart with tasks from a specific folder, project, or space: This option will work if all your tasks are included within a specific location. To apply it, select a folder, project, or space in Step 3 of creating a chart.
Build a chart with tasks from the whole account: Choose this option if tasks that your team is working on are spread across different folders, projects, and spaces. To apply it, don't select anything in Step 3 of creating a chart.
Build a chart with tasks from several folders or projects: Select this option if your tasks are spread across several locations. To use it, first create a new folder in a space, include all necessary folders and projects in that new folder, and then select this new folder in Step 3 of creating a chart."
834,Create a Workload Chart,"To create a Workload chart:
Click the “Workload” tab (at the top of the workspace).
Click “Create Workload chart.”
In the pop-up that opens:
Specify the chart’s title.
Select users or user groups whose workload you want to view on the chart:
Select the ""Custom list"" option if you want to add users to the chart manually.
Select ""Account members"" to link the workload chart to the list of all users in the account (including collaborators). You won't be able to edit the list of users manually, but if users are added to the account, they’ll be automatically added to the list of users for this Workload chart. The same is true for when you delete a user from the account.
Select “Current user” to make the chart show only the workload of the user that opens the chart.
To see all users (including collaborators) and edit the list manually, click ""Unlink"" at the center of the pop-up. Note that if you choose this option,, you’ll have to add/delete users from the Workload chart manually.
To remove all users from the Custom list, click the ""Clear all"" button.
(Optional) Select a folder, project, or space to pull tasks from. Click “Advanced settings” and “Select Folder or Project.” Select a folder, project, or space from the list (or start typing its name and select it once it appears).
Click “Create.”
Your chart is created and you can see the selected users and tasks from the selected location assigned to these users. Now you can proceed to configure the Backlog Box which will contain the tasks that need to be allocated to users on the Workload chart.
 Note! Folder-, project-, or space-based Workload charts display tasks from the selected folder/project location as well as tasks from all subfolders and subprojects."
835,Navigate Workload Charts,"To open a chart:
Click the “Workload” tab (at the top of the workspace).

User list
Users selected during the chart creation appear on the left side.
Calendar grid
On the grid you can see the total daily or weekly amount of allocated effort per user.
Drag the grid to the left to see previous time periods or drag right to see the future ones.
Today’s date is marked with a red vertical line on the grid.
Gray cells represent non-working days. On weekly view, weekends are visible only when you drag and drop tasks or create new ones.
Allocated effort
The calendar grid part of the chart shows a user’s workload. Wrike adds up effort required for all tasks assigned to a person and scheduled for a particular day or week and shows the number in this day’s or week’s column and this user’s row.
Wrike uses a color-coding system to show how busy a person is. If the daily effort of a user is:
0 hours: The cell is white.
0-8 hours: A portion of the cell representing the occupied time is colored pale blue.
8+ hours: The cell is red.
You can also set a custom allocation limit for each user on the chart whose workdays differ from 8 hours. In this case, the cell color will depend on the individual settings.
Tasks
Click on the caret icon to the left of a user’s name to display the tasks assigned to them on the calendar grid.
Tasks are represented by bars that extend from the task’s start to end date.
The bars are color-coded based on the task’s status. Tasks with specified effort have brighter colored bars than tasks without it.
The horizontal red line above some tasks means that these tasks have the flexible effort type and the total effort is different from the sum of allocated hours.
Note: You can create and edit tasks directly from a Workload chart. Visit the Manage Tasks on Workload Charts page to learn how to do that."

857,Overview,"Backlog Box is an essential part of Workload charts. It contains tasks that need to be allocated to users. You can use Backlog Box to define the scope of future workload for your team members. For example:
If you use request forms, build a Backlog Box based on a folder, project, or space containing your team’s incoming requests.
When launching a new project, you can duplicate a template and use that newly created project as the source for your Backlog Box, from which to allocate tasks to your team members.
This page is an overview of the Backlog Box feature which is a part of the Workload charts. To learn about Workload charts please visit the Workload Charts page."
858,Important Information,"Each Workload chart has its own Backlog Box that you can reconfigure at any time.
At least one of the following must be true for a task to appear in the Backlog Box:
A task is not scheduled.
A task is unassigned to users (but it might be assigned to a job role)."
859,Configure Backlog Box,"To configure the Backlog Box in your Workload chart for the first time:
Click the “Workload” tab at the top of the workspace.
Select the Workload chart for which you want to configure the Backlog Box from the list.
Click “Backlog Box” in the upper-right corner.
Click the gear icon.

Apply filters, if necessary. The preview window on the pop-up shows what tasks will appear in the Backlog Box based on current filters.
Click “Apply.”
The Backlog Box for the Workload chart is configured, and now you can:
Drag tasks from the Backlog Box to the chart to assign them to users.
Move tasks from the chart to the Backlog Box.
Create new tasks directly from the Backlog Box.
* If you don’t select anything in Step 3, the Backlog Box will show tasks from all folders, projects, and spaces."
860,Backlog Box Display Options,"There are two ways you can display the Backlog Box:
Vertically
The box appears on the right side of the view.
The vertical Backlog Box contains tasks that are either unassigned to users or unscheduled.
Tasks are automatically grouped according to their dates.
Horizontally
The box appears at the bottom of the view.
The horizontal Backlog Box only displays tasks that are both scheduled and unassigned to users.
Tasks are automatically grouped according to the job role that they’re assigned to and the project that they’re in.
To switch between a vertical and horizontal view of the Backlog Box, click on the icon  at the top of the Box.
Note: Both vertical and horizontal Backlog Box views automatically calculate the number of tasks in the Box and display it next to the Box title. Task count across the two views might be different because the horizontal Box doesn’t display unscheduled tasks.
Wrike Tip! For tasks that are assigned to a job role and have allocated effort, use the horizontal view of the Backlog Box to see the effort on the grid before assigning the tasks to users."
861,Edit Backlog Box Settings,"Reconfigure your Backlog Box to allocate another set of tasks (e.g., tasks from another project you have started working on).

Select the relevant Workload chart from the list.
Click “Backlog Box” to see a list of tasks in your backlog.
Click and hold the task you want to assign.
Drag the task to the new assignee.
Release your mouse.
Once you move a task from the Backlog Box to the chart:
The task is assigned to a person shown in the row into which you dropped it (any additional assignees are also kept).
The task disappears from the Backlog Box and appears on the Workload chart.
If you specified a folder, project, or space during the chart creation, the task is tagged to it (unless it was tagged with its subfolder/subproject).
Conditional changes:
If the task was already scheduled, it keeps its original dates.
If the task was backlogged without duration, it’s automatically scheduled for the current date with a one-day duration.
If the task had a duration, its start date is scheduled for the current date, unless it's the weekend, and the end date is calculated automatically according to the duration.
If the task was assigned to a job role and you move it to a user with a matching role, the job role is automatically replaced with the new assignee (if you don’t want the job role to be automatically replaced when dragging the task to the user with the matching role, press the “Ctrl” key while dragging the task (“Option” key on Mac).
If the task was assigned to one or more job roles and you drag it from the vertical Backlog Box to a user with a different job role, all previously assigned job roles are replaced with the new assignee. In that case, you’ll see a pop-up asking you to confirm the change."

Note: The ""Move to backlog"" option is only shown in the three-dot menu when the Backlog Box is configured.
Once you move the task from the Workload chart to the Backlog Box:
It disappears from the Workload chart and appears in the Backlog Box.
The task keeps the same dates as it had on the chart.
Conditional changes:
If the task had a job role that was automatically replaced once it was assigned to a user with the matching role via drag-and-drop, the job role will be assigned back to the task when you select “Move to backlog.”
Wrike Tip! Alternatively, to move a task to backlog, unassign it from the team members who are displayed on the Workload chart."
865,Overview,"Effort is a task attribute that shows how much time is required to complete a task. It can be different from duration which indicates the time period within which an assignee should complete the task. For example, a task can span multiple days but require only several hours of work a day from each of its assignees."
866,Important Information,"Effort is displayed in hours and minutes; however, you can enter time in days (e.g. “8d”) and it’ll be automatically converted into hours.
When you add basic or full-time effort to tasks that have job roles as assignees, effort is automatically equally distributed among users and job roles."
867,Tasks without Effort,"When you create a task, it doesn't have effort by default. Tasks without effort can be used as:
Action items which don't require time to complete.
Non-action items: meetings notes, specifications, etc.
To effectively manage your resources, specify effort for all action items which require time to complete.
Note! Since milestones don’t have a duration, effort can’t be applied to them.
You can also set default effort for all new tasks::
Click on your profile picture in your Workspace's upper-right corner.
Select ""Settings"" from the dropdown.
""Profile"" opens by default.
Scroll to the ""Tasks & Subtasks"" section.
Click the dropdown field under ""Default Effort mode for new tasks.""
Select the default effort type for new tasks.
Click ""Save changes."""
868,Effort Types,"There are three types of effort in Wrike: Basic, Full-time, and Flexible.
Basic effort type works when your team members have to switch between several tasks during the day, and all task assignees equally contribute to its completion.
Use case: Estimate if all tasks can be completed during a workweek.
When Basic effort type is selected:
Effort and duration are completely independent of each other.
Effort is spread evenly among duration and all task assignees.
Use Full-time effort type if task assignees should dedicate all their time to a single task.
Use case: tasks which take 100% of assignees' working hours.
When Full-time effort type is selected:
Effort is linked with duration. You cannot change effort without changing duration.
Effort is calculated as the number of task assignees multiplied by a number of their working hours (where working hours are equal to a number of working days multiplied by 8).
Select a Flexible effort type to gain full control over effort allocation.
Use case: tasks which require a different amount of time from different assignees and on different days.
When Flexible effort type is selected:
You can specify the number of hours independently for each assignee and working day.
You see how many hours you have already allocated and the total effort, so you always know how many hours are yet to be allotted.
Note: hours specified using this Effort type are fixed to the user and nominated date(s) or job role. Rescheduling or reassignment will clear the previously set effort."
869,Basic,"Basic effort type works when your team members have to switch between several tasks during the day, and all task assignees equally contribute to its completion.

880,Overview,"The default daily capacity limit for all users on Workload charts is 8 hours. Custom capacity allocation allows you to change the daily limit for team members on Workload charts if their working days differ from the traditional 8-hour day.
Once you set a custom capacity for one or more of the team members, Wrike will take this setting into account when color-coding the cells on the chart according to the allocated effort."
881,Important Information,"Custom capacity allocation is only available in Workload charts. Custom working hours on Workload charts won’t affect working hours in any other Wrike feature.
Custom capacity settings are applied per chart, so you need to configure the Custom capacity allocation for each Workload chart separately."
882,Configure Custom Capacity Allocation,"Regular and External users can configure and edit the custom capacity on Workload charts unless their access role restricts it.
Go to the Workload tab at the top of your workspace.
Select the relevant Workload chart from the list.
Click the three-dot menu button in the upper-right corner of the chart.
Select “Custom capacity.”
In the window that opens, you can:
Set the same custom capacity for all users on the Workload chart: Enter the needed number of work hours in the “Default daily capacity” field.
Set a custom capacity for one or more users individually: Enter the custom working hours number in the field next to each user’s name.
Note: You can enter any whole number from 0 to 24 as the custom capacity. Fractions with up to two digits after the decimal point are also supported, i.e., “1.5h” or “1.25h.”
Click “Apply.”
Refresh the page.
You can use the same steps to edit the custom capacity of users on the Workload chart.
When the custom capacity is set for the users on this Workload chart, it’s reflected on the grid:
The cells with 0 effort allocation are white.
The cells with the effort allocation from 0 to the custom capacity limit that you set are partially colored in pale blue (the amount of cell coloring is proportionate to the ratio between free time and allocated effort).
The cells where the number of allocated hours is the same as the custom capacity or exceeds it are colored in red.
You can see the custom capacity set for all users of the chart above the user list under “Daily capacity.” Individual custom capacity is displayed to the right of each user’s name."
883,Overview,"Job roles are a grouping category in Wrike. Create custom job roles specific to your company, for example, “designer” or “mobile developer,” and allocate them to users in your account to make future project planning easier. In combination with other features, job roles help you to distribute work among employees, taking into account their available time and required effort. You can read more about how to use job roles below."
884,Important Information,"You can assign job roles to all types of users, including collaborators.
Each user can only have one job role allocated to them.
You can group tasks in the backlog box of Workload charts by the job role to which they are assigned.
There is no limit to the number of job roles you can create in the account."
885,How to Use Job Roles,"Job Roles are designed to help you with planning and staffing your new projects and effectively distributing work among employees based on their workload.
Use job roles:
To effectively organize your new projects and confirm that you have enough resources to finish them successfully.
To group your employees based on what they do in your company.
To assign tasks to these groups of employees without notifying or sharing the task with them.
There are a few simple steps to staffing your projects using job roles in Wrike:
Create job roles and allocate them to users in your account.
Identify or create projects that need to be staffed and assign tasks within these projects to job roles. This way all users who have access to the projects will know exactly which talent is required to complete them.
Set effort that’s required to finish each task within the projects and define tasks’ start and end dates This lets you get an overview of how much time employees will need to finish the tasks and over which period of time.
Create or open an existing Workload chart to distribute tasks among employees. Workload chart shows employees’ current workload, so you can easily determine which of them have enough time to finish the tasks that you are about to assign to them.
Tip! Create a separate workload chart for each group of employees with the same job role. It’ll be easier to see the workload of all available employees before assigning tasks to them.
Set the horizontal backlog box in the Workload chart to show all tasks from the projects that need staffing. Tasks in the box are automatically grouped by job role and project.
All that’s left is to assign tasks to users. Once you match the task that is assigned to a certain job role with the actual user who has that job role allocated to them, the job role will disappear from the list of assignees automatically.
User groups make sharing data and notifying large groups of account users easier. The purpose of job roles, on the other hand, is to help you clearly define which talent you will require to perform tasks.
That’s why, unlike user groups, job roles can be added as task assignees. At the same time, when you assign a task to a job role, users with this role don’t get any notifications, and they don’t automatically get access to the task. This way you can plan projects without distracting your employees with unnecessary @mentions. However, later you can group all tasks assigned to a certain job role on the Workload chart and distribute them among your employees while also confirming that they have enough time to successfully finish the tasks."
886,How to Staff Projects Using Job Roles,"There are a few simple steps to staffing your projects using job roles in Wrike:
Create job roles and allocate them to users in your account.
Identify or create projects that need to be staffed and assign tasks within these projects to job roles. This way all users who have access to the projects will know exactly which talent is required to complete them.
Set effort that’s required to finish each task within the projects and define tasks’ start and end dates This lets you get an overview of how much time employees will need to finish the tasks and over which period of time.

895,Overview,The billable time setting allows you to set up the projects and tasks that your employees work on as billable or non-billable in one click. Filter and group tasks and projects to see which of them you need to bill your customers or pay contractors for.
896,Important Information,"Billing type can only be set for projects and tasks. Folders and spaces can’t be billable.
When you create a task, the system automatically checks the billing type of the project that the task is housed within and sets the task billing type the same as that of the project. For example, if your billable project contains a folder and you create a task in that folder, the task will be set as billable by default. But you can manually change the task to non-billable.
When you create a task in a folder that is tagged in both a billable and a non-billable project, this task will be set as billable by default."
897,Set Up Billing Type for Projects,"Regular and external users can set projects and tasks as billable or non-billable unless it’s restricted by their access role.

901,Track Billable Hours,"All users who work on tasks in Wrike, except for collaborators, can track their working time using two ways:
By adding time entries in time tracker.
By adding time entries in timesheets.
Wrike Tip! Use Wrike’s mobile apps for Android and iOS to add time entries in timesheets on the go. In both apps, you can add Timesheets to the main screens for easy access and set up daily or weekly notifications that’ll remind you to add time entries.
Android users can also integrate Google Calendars with Timesheets and easily add time spent on meetings and other scheduled tasks. Plus, the Android app will automatically calculate the billable and non-billable time totals, provide a weekly summary, and highlight tasks that require attention.
When you add a time entry using either of the methods mentioned above, it’s automatically marked as billable or non-billable, depending on the task’s billing type. Unlike the billing type of tasks and projects, the time entries’ billing type cannot be changed manually. But when you change the billing type of a task that has time entries, all its entries automatically change their billing type too."

10 Signs You're Making the Most of Wrike"
987,Overview,Wrike Report column charts show the number of tasks or Projects that meet the criteria you select in the Report Builder. Each column chart has two Groupings and those groupings are used to divide your data into columns (Grouping one) and then to further divide those columns into segments (Grouping two).
988,Best Practices,"Column charts are best used when you need to:
View a count of the number of tasks or Projects which meet specified criteria and see that data in a simple view.
Compare the number of tasks or Projects within a specified Grouping at a glance.
Use column charts to:
Monitor Project progress by project owner. You can see how many Projects each owner has and what the statuses of their projects are.
Track task progress by assignee. Stay up to date with how much each assignee has on their plate and what statuses their tasks are in."
989,Undefined Columns,"Undefined data refers to task or Project attributes which do not have data entered for that attribute. For example, a task without a designated start date would have undefined start date data. If you create a column chart, add a Grouping, and there are tasks or Projects which match the report criteria but which have undefined data for the selected grouping, then a column (or segment) is added to the chart to capture those tasks.
For example, if a Project report is grouped by a Custom Field and the Project doesn’t have data entered for that Custom Field, then it appears in the “Undefined” column or segment. There is also a “None” column that is used when there are tasks without an assignee or Projects without a project owner."

1071,Overview,"Project Risk Report is a feature based on the company’s proprietary machine learning technology. Once you enable Project Risk Report, Wrike AI will analyze all active projects that you are the owner of and predict how likely each project is to be completed on time. Project risk assessment takes into account dozens of factors including project complexity, the number of completed and overdue tasks, the number of assignees, task activity, the history of the owner’s previous projects, and many others.
You’ll receive a weekly Project Risk Report email with the risk assessments based on the results of Wrike’s automated prediction. If a project is at risk of not meeting the deadline, it’ll be highlighted in the email. For projects with high and medium risk levels, the machine learning model also provides the list of factors that contribute to potential issues so you can proactively address them."
1072,Important Information,"Project Risk Report emails are sent automatically every Monday at approximately 9 a.m. (EST).
Project Risk Report includes only projects that you are the owner of. Only active projects that meet specific essential criteria about duration, content, etc. will receive a risk assessment. Other projects will appear in the emails under the “Not Assessed” section with the corresponding reasons.
The more accurate and up to date the details in your projects are (i.e., dates, status, project’s tasks info, etc.), the more precise the risk predictions in reports will be."

1074,Overview,"Wrike Integrate is an add-on helping you to integrate Wrike with almost any app (including with Wrike itself) and automate your business workflows across apps and employees. Wrike Integrate helps you to accelerate business processes, boost collaboration and improve productivity.
With Wrike Integrate, you can connect Wrike with hundreds of business apps such as CRM (e.g. SalesForce), marketing (e.g. Marketo or MailChimp), accounting (e.g. QuickBooks or Netsuite) or HR (e.g. Workday). Explore our App Directory for apps which offer prebuilt connectors that you can integrate with, in a codeless fashion."
1075,Important Information,"Integrations are set up on the Wrike Integrate portal, which is accessible from the Wrike workspace.
Wrike Integrate is powered by a partner: Workato. For more detailed information on how to integrate Wrike with other apps, please check out Workato’s Help Center.
Only account owners and admins can integrate Wrike with other apps using Wrike Integrate. Enterprise admins should have the “Configure integration recipes” right enabled."
1076,How It Works,"Wrike Integrate uses recipes to connect apps. Recipes are automated workflows which comprise of a trigger (business event that will kick off the recipe), and one or more actions that are carried out when a trigger event is picked up. Either trigger or at least one action for every recipe must happen in Wrike.
Recipes run automatically in the background. When they are stopped, they will cease to look for trigger events. When a recipe is started again, it picks up all the trigger events that occurred since the recipe was last stopped.
When creating recipes, you can also have them triggered at a certain time and use various logic (eg if-then-else forks or loops) all without writing any code.
More information on how recipes work can be found here."
1077,How to Set Up Integrations in Wrike,"Click on your name in the upper right-hand corner of the workspace.
Select the “Apps & Integrations”.
Find the needed app from the list of integrations in the “App Directory” section and click on it. If the app you are looking for is not in the list, you can still connect to it using universal connectors.
Select which app is the trigger app (ie. the one that will cause the recipe to start) and which one is the action app (ie. where the recipe will make changes). You can add other actions later from within the Wrike Integrate interface.
Click “Create new recipe”.
The Wrike Integrate portal page opens where you can set your recipe.
Once you proceed to the Wrike Integrate portal, you'll be guided through the process of setting up trigger and action details, steps and conditions.

However, if ""RE"" is in the subject line then Wrike ignores the unique email address. If you would like to send the task to a specific folder/project and ""RE"" is in the subject line, then you must format your subject line to specify which folder/project the task should be added into.
Adding ""RE:"" and ""FW:"" in the beginning of the subject line allows you to edit existing tasks.

Type the task’s title in the subject line. (required)
Add any relevant task details. Adding additional task details is optional. If you choose not to specify task due dates, or a status then the task is created as active and Wrike will apply the default folder and date parameters specified in your profile. If you do not specify the folder/project in which the task should be created, then the task will automatically be created in the folder/project/space specified in profile settings.
Format your subject line. Apart from containing the task title, you can use the subject line to specify any or all of the following: the folder/subfolder where a task should be created, status of the task, and task start and/or due dates.To format your subject line:list the information in any order, but make sure that you put the folder title, start/due dates, and task status in brackets. For example, you could put: task title [Folder title] [start date - due date] [task status].
Add email recipients in the “To” field. The task will be assigned to Wrike users whose emails are listed in the “To” field.
Send the task to Wrike. There are a few different options for how to do this:
Include “wrike@wrike.com” in the “To” or “CC” field. If “wrike@wrike.com” is the only recipient, the task is assigned to you. If you want to keep the task unassigned put “wrike@wrike.com” in the “BCC” field as the only recipient.
If you frequently email tasks to the same folder, you can add its unique email address (wrike+intoFolderID@wrike.com)to your contact book. Then, you can email the task directly to that email address. If you do this, you will not have to include the folder or project's name in the subject line (unless ""RE"" is also in the subject line). To find a folder’s email address, go to “Folder info” 1, click on “Permalink” 2, and then copy the email address listed under “E-mail for sending tasks to this folder”.
Click Send and your task will be added to Wrike!"
1116,Add a Task to a Folder via Email,"When you are creating a task via email you can add that task to an existing folder or add the task to a new folder.

If there are several folders or subfolders with the same name, specify the folder path to put the task in the correct folder. To create a folder path, list all parent folders, separating each with slashes and include brackets around the list. For example: [marketing/events/conferences]
You can also use a folder’s unique email address to send a task directly to that folder.
To add a task to a new folder:Add your new folder’s name (in square brackets) to the subject line. If the folder does not exist yet, Wrike creates a new folder and adds the task to that folder. If you send an email to wrike@wrike.com address, a new folder will be created in the “Shared with me” section. You can also create a task in a new subfolder by specifying the folder path and then adding your new subfolders name to the end of the path. New folders created via email are only shared with those people who have access to its parent folder and if there is no parent folder then the folder is private. Folders created via email are not automatically shared with the email recipients.

1124,Email a Comment to an Existing Task,"There are several ways to send a comment to an existing task:
If you received any notification emails about the task, just reply to the notification email and keepwrike@wrike.com(orwrike+taskID@wrike.com) among the recipients. Wrike’s Intelligent Email Engine™ cuts out signatures and repeating text and adds only your message as a comment.
In case there is an email you would like to forward to a task andadd its contents as a comment, send it towrike@wrike.comand putRe: [Folder Name] Task titlein the subject line 1. Once Wrike receives an email that contains Re: in the subject line, it searches for the task by title and adds your comment from the email body to the activity stream of the task. If several tasks with the same name are found within the specified folder, you will get an email about this conflict. If Wrike can’t find your task in the folder you mention it will try searching your entire workspace for a matching task.
The other way to add a comment to an existing task is by sending an email to the task’s unique email address 2. In this case, Wrike locates the task by its ID which means that you don’t need to worry about specifying the correct folder path in the subject line (but you do need to have some text in the subject line, a comment won't be added if the subject line is completely empty)."
1125,Advanced Features,"You can email a task to a subfolder just like you would email it to a folder. If you have several subfolders with the same name, provide the folder path to put the task in the right place. To create a folder path just list all parent folders, separating each with slashes, and put brackets around the list.
To do this, list all the folder names you would like to include the task in, separate the folder names with commas, and make sure to include square brackets around the folder list. Unless you specify a status, the task’s workflow is taken from the first folder in the list.
Instead of including start and due date, specify only the due date : [MM/DD].
In most cases @mentioning cannot be done when sending a comment to Wrike via email. However, if someone @mentions you, and you reply via email, then your response is posted as a comment in Wrike and the person who @mentioned you is automatically @mentioned in your comment."
1126,Email a Task to a Subfolder,"You can email a task to a subfolder just like you would email it to a folder. If you have several subfolders with the same name, provide the folder path to put the task in the right place.

1130,Overview,"Salesforce is a popular CRM solution used by teams worldwide. Wrike is integrated with Salesforce so you can manage client projects from within Salesforce. This makes collaboration between sales or other customer-facing teams and teams using Wrike easier, faster, and more transparent. More information on Salesforce is available here.
Once the integration is set up, you can check task status from within Salesforce. Any object in Salesforce can be linked to a Wrike project or folder so you can work in Wrike and any changes that you make are instantly reflected in Salesforce.
Both Salesforce Classic and Salesforce Lightning are supported."
1131,Benefits of Salesforce-to-Wrike Integration,"No need to toggle between systems because Salesforce users can work exclusively in Salesforce and still communicate easily with their customers about work managed in Wrike.
You have greater transparency and accountability so you don’t need to chase down your colleagues for updates on pending tasks. You can can check task status right from either Salesforce or Wrike.
You can automate creation of projects and tasks in Wrike for Salesforce records using built-in templates or Wrike Integrate.
Every record page in Salesforce (on an object where the integration is enabled) has a Wrike Widget. You can select or change a project or folder the widget shows linked tasks and subfolders from. From there, you can access tasks and check their status.
If the project or folder is not selected for the Salesforce record, you can create it from the widget and populate it with template set by admin.
The integration between Wrike and Salesforce is customizable, which means that you can tailor it to suit your needs by selecting which Salesforce objects (e.g., Lead, Opportunity, Account, Subscription) you want to link with Wrike. On objects where the integration is enabled, record pages will have the Wrike widget, and you can link Wrike tasks with those records. Record pages on objects where the integration is not enabled will not have the widget."

Open a folder, project, or a task in Wrike.
Filter the task list to find child entities by name or status.
Create a folder or project in Wrike for a Salesforce record and populate it with templates from Wrike."
1135,Setting Up the Integration,"Before proceeding, please make sure that:
Your organization has an Enterprise or Unlimited edition of Salesforce.
You have a Salesforce profile with rights to install packages. (Salesforce account administrators have this access.)
You are an account administrator on a Wrike Business or Enterprise account.

1140,Automating the Wrike-Salesforce Binding,"In most cases, it’s important to automate the binding between Wrike and Salesforce so the folder (and any tasks in it) for all Opportunities, Accounts, or other objects is created without any manual effort. In Salesforce, this requires a Wrike Mapping object with two attributes:
Salesforce ID - The identifier of the record in Salesforce
Wrike ID - The API Identifier of the space, folder, or project in Wrike
You can create these records automatically by using Salesforce and the Wrike API, or by utilizing Wrike Integrate. This recipe clones a template in Wrike when an Opportunity in Salesforce is Closed Won, and associates the Opportunity with a new project so that the Wrike widget displays the tasks."
1141,Overview,"Wrike for Office Documents (Wrike's Office add-in) allows you to create a file in Microsoft Word, Excel, or Powerpoint and then, right from that program, attach your file to a Wrike task.

Create a Folder or Project
Create a Subfolder
Create a Task
Create a Milestone Task
Include a Task in Several Folders
Create Subtasks
Add a Task Description
Add a Task Status
Create a Dependency
Please remember, each row should have a unique number in the “Key” column.
In the “Title” column (of an empty row) type in the preferred name for your folder or project.
Include forward slashes before and after the folder/project name. For example: /folder name/. 1
For projects: specify a project status in the ""Status"" column. To add custom project status, add a column called ""Default task workflow"" prior to the column ""Title"" and add the name of the workflow in front of the project’s name. Make sure to fill in the “Custom workflow” cell and the “Custom Status” cell accordingly.
Note! Currently only Business and Enterprise accounts created after 4/15/2019 have Custom Workflows for projects.
In a new row, click the cell in the corresponding “Title” column, type the parent folder’s name (with slashes before and after the name), followed by the title of your subfolder. For example: /folder name/subfolder name. 2
Adding a task in Excel is easy: just enter the task’s title in the “Title” column. Then use the other columns to enter any additional information you would like to specify about the task 3. If you would like to create your task within a folder: first create the folder (per steps above), then add the task in a row immediately beneath the folder's row.
Add start and end dates for the tasks using the slash symbol as a separator (for example: 23/10/2019) . The duration is calculated automatically, based on start and end dates. The end date is calculated automatically when you add the start date and duration. If the start and end dates are in place and you manually add the duration, which is more than the automatically calculated duration, the end date will be shifted after the import and will be adjusted to fit the duration.
Enter the task’s title in the “Title” column. Add a date in the ""End Date"" column, but leave the ""Start Date"" column empty. Then use the other columns to enter any additional information pertaining to the task.
To include a task in several folders, begin by adding your task to one folder. Then, to include the task in an additional folder, simply copy the entire row with the task information (including the key number) and paste it beneath another folder. 1
Add data as you normally would for a task and then add the parent task's name in the ""Parent Task"" column. The parent task must appear in the file before the subtask. 2
If you would like to create a subtask of the subtask, the entire task path has to be specified in the “Parent task” column.
Note! In order to perform XLS import, the parent task and subtask cannot have the same name. There should be at least one symbol of difference.
Add your description in the “Description” field. Data entered there is added to the description section of the task in Wrike. 3
Add a status to a task by typing one of the default statuses in a task’s “Status” column 1. For accounts created before 12/20/2016 the default statuses are: active, completed, deferred and cancelled. For accounts created after 12/20/2016 the default statuses are new, in progress, on hold, completed and cancelled.
Business and Enterprise users have the option to add a Custom Status to a task. First, go to the task row where you would like to add the custom status, type in the custom workflow’s name in the “Workflow” column 2 and then type the desired status in the “Custom Status” column 3. If the Custom status or workflow cannot be found upon import, then a status from the default workflow will be applied.
A dependency between two tasks can be created by using the “Depends On” column 1. Go to the row of the task for which you would like to add a dependency and, in the “Depends On” column, enter the key number of the task 2 on which the current task will be dependent. In the same cell (without any spaces) add one of our dependency codes 3. For example, your “Depends On” cell might look like this: 5FS. If you want to add several dependencies, separate them using a comma and space (for example: 22SS, 32FS). Lastly, add start and end dates for the task in the appropriate columns (or only an end date if the task is a milestone).
Accepted dependency codes:
FS – the dependent task starts when the predecessor task finishes
SS* – the dependent task starts when the predecessor task starts
FF – the dependent task finishes when the predecessor task finishes
SF* – the dependent task finishes when the predecessor task starts
* The dependency type is not applicable to Milestone tasks
Please note, upon import to Wrike, dependent tasks are automatically rescheduled to start as early as possible without breaking the dependencies. However, you can delay some dependent tasks by specifying their preferred start dates in the start date constraints column. Dependencies do not affect dates of milestones and if the dependency that includes a milestone causes a conflict, it will be highlighted in red on the Gantt Chart after the import."
1182,Create a Folder or Project,"In the “Title” column (of an empty row) type in the preferred name for your folder or project.
Include forward slashes before and after the folder/project name. For example: /folder name/. 1
For projects: specify a project status in the ""Status"" column. To add custom project status, add a column called ""Default task workflow"" prior to the column ""Title"" and add the name of the workflow in front of the project’s name. Make sure to fill in the “Custom workflow” cell and the “Custom Status” cell accordingly.

1188,Add a Task Description,Add your description in the “Description” field. Data entered there is added to the description section of the task in Wrike. 3
1189,Add a task Status,"Add a status to a task by typing one of the default statuses in a task’s “Status” column 1. For accounts created before 12/20/2016 the default statuses are: active, completed, deferred and cancelled. For accounts created after 12/20/2016 the default statuses are new, in progress, on hold, completed and cancelled.
Business and Enterprise users have the option to add a Custom Status to a task. First, go to the task row where you would like to add the custom status, type in the custom workflow’s name in the “Workflow” column 2 and then type the desired status in the “Custom Status” column 3. If the Custom status or workflow cannot be found upon import, then a status from the default workflow will be applied."
1190,Create a Dependency,"A dependency between two tasks can be created by using the “Depends On” column 1. Go to the row of the task for which you would like to add a dependency and, in the “Depends On” column, enter the key number of the task 2 on which the current task will be dependent. In the same cell (without any spaces) add one of our dependency codes 3. For example, your “Depends On” cell might look like this: 5FS. If you want to add several dependencies, separate them using a comma and space (for example: 22SS, 32FS). Lastly, add start and end dates for the task in the appropriate columns (or only an end date if the task is a milestone).
Accepted dependency codes:
FS – the dependent task starts when the predecessor task finishes
SS* – the dependent task starts when the predecessor task starts
FF – the dependent task finishes when the predecessor task finishes
SF* – the dependent task finishes when the predecessor task starts
* The dependency type is not applicable to Milestone tasks
Please note, upon import to Wrike, dependent tasks are automatically rescheduled to start as early as possible without breaking the dependencies. However, you can delay some dependent tasks by specifying their preferred start dates in the start date constraints column. Dependencies do not affect dates of milestones and if the dependency that includes a milestone causes a conflict, it will be highlighted in red on the Gantt Chart after the import."

There are three steps to creating your first sync:
Step 1: Enable project syncs add-on in your Wrike account
Step 2: Create a Bitbucket test repository and sync account
Step 3: Sync setup between Wrike and Bitbucket
Before setting up the two-way sync between Wrike and Bitbucket, you need to enable the Project Syncs Add-On in your Wrike account. You can find instructions on how to do that on the Project Syncs overview page.
Each sync setup begins with creating a folder or project in Wrike and a repository in Bitbucket that will be connected. To help you get a feel for how the sync works, create a test repository in Bitbucket and use it for your first sync.
Create a sync account in Bitbucket to better track when updates are made as a result of the sync. If you use a sync account and a user updates a task’s title in Wrike, then in Bitbucket you’ll see that the title of the synced issue was updated by the sync account. If you don’t use a sync account, then Bitbucket shows that a user (the user whose credentials you use to set up the sync) updated the issue.
To create a sync account, create a new Bitbucket user and name it “Wrike Bot.” Visit Unito’s Help Center to read more about what permissions the Wrike Bot account needs. Make sure you give the bot account access to the folder you want to sync.
Please note: You only need to create a sync account in Bitbucket. In Wrike, there’s a special bot called “Unito Bot for Two-Way Sync” that is automatically added to your Wrike account when you set up the integration.
To create your first sync:

1242,Overview,"The Wrike and GitLab two-way sync allows automatic updates between Wrike tasks and GitLab issues. Select a GitLab project that you’d like to sync with Wrike and:
Wrike creates a task for each issue in the GitLab project.
For any task created in, or added to, the synced folder or project in Wrike, Wrike creates a GitLab issue in the synced project.
When you update a linked Wrike task, then the linked GitLab issue is automatically updated (and vice versa).
Once the sync is in place, Wrike tasks become linked with corresponding GitLab issues and when you update a linked task, then the linked issue is automatically updated as well (and vice-versa). Your teams are able to collaborate effectively while remaining in the tool that they’re most familiar with.
Please note: This page goes over how to sync tasks and issues between Wrike and GitLab. For details on what you can do once the sync is in place, please see Wrike and GitLab Two-Way Sync: Overview."
1243,Important Information,"The Wrike and GitLab two-way sync is powered by a partner: Unito.io. For even more information about how the two-way sync works, please check out Unito’s Help Center.
When you set up the integration, a Wrike Bot is automatically created for you. The bot doesn't take up a Wrike user seat. A sync account is not automatically set up in GitLab, and we strongly recommend creating one prior to setting up the first sync. You’ll find more details on how to do that below."
1244,Set Up the Sync,"Admins on Business and higher plans can enable the Wrike and GitLab two-way sync.
There are three steps to creating your first sync:
Step 1: Enable project syncs add-on in your Wrike account
Step 2: Create a GitLab test project and sync account
Step 3: Sync setup between Wrike and GitLab
Before setting up the two-way sync between Wrike and GitLab, you need to enable the Project Syncs Add-On in your Wrike account. You can find instructions on how to do that on the Project Syncs overview page.
Each sync setup begins with creating a folder or project in Wrike and a project in GitLab that will be connected. To help you get a feel for how the sync works, create a test project in Wrike and in GitLab and use these projects for your first sync.
Create a sync account in GitLab to better track when updates are made as a result of the sync. If you use a sync account and a user updates a task’s title in Wrike, then in GitLab you’ll see that the title of the synced issue was updated by the sync account. If you don’t use a sync account, then GitLab will show that the user, whose credentials you selected to
set up the sync, updated the issue.
To create a sync account, create a new GitLab user and name it “Wrike Bot.” Visit Unito’s Help Center to read more about what permissions the Wrike Bot account requires. Make sure you give the bot account access to the GitLab projects you want to sync.
Please note: You only need to create a sync account in GitLab. In Wrike, there’s a special bot called “Unito Bot for Two-Way Sync” that is automatically added to your Wrike account when you set up the integration.
To create the first sync:
Click your profile image in the upper-right corner of the Wrike account.
Select “Apps and integrations.”
Click the “Project syncs” tab in the left panel.
(Optional) If there are multiple Wrike accounts associated with your email, select the relevant one.
Click the “Add sync” button.
You’ll see two cards on the screen for the two systems that you sync. The card on the right is reserved for Wrike by default.
Click the “Add another tool” option on the left card.
Select GitLab.
You’ll see a pop up with 2 options: “GitLab” and “GitLab.com.”
If you choose the “GitLab” option, enter your GitLab URL and follow the steps that will appear in the pop-up to set up your OAuth application.
If you choose the “GitLab.com” option, log in using the credentials of the bot account you created and authorize Unito.
After login, select the existing GitLab project you wish to sync or create a new one from the “Project” drop-down.
After setting up the GitLab card, select a connector for Wrike on the right card:
The “Wrike via Unito Bot for Two-Way Sync” option is selected automatically. If you keep this option selected, GitLab will show that the bot has updated the issue. In this case, if you are creating the first sync, you need to create a Wrike project or folder which will be integrated with GitLab. That project or folder will be available for selection in the future syncs.
If you choose “Wrike via Username” option, then the updates in GitLab will show that the user whose credentials you select to set up the sync updated the issue.
After both cards are set up, scroll down to choose the preferred sync direction.
Click “Next.” You’ll be directed to a page where you can configure filters.
Leave the filters as is to sync all issues and tasks by default.
Click “Next.”
You’ll see the “Options” section. Here, you can disable Test Mode and Auto Sync and customize workflow and content.
Click the “Create sync” button when all the preferred configurations are set up.
Your sync is created.

Open the synced Wrike Folder (the Folder where JIRA issues are added) and create a task in that folder.
Open an existing task and tag the task in the synced Wrike Folder.
An issue (based on the task) is created in the synced JIRA project. The time the sync takes depends on the Unito subscription you have. Users that set up the integration within Wrike have the “Free with Wrike” plan by default, which takes up to 5 minutes to sync the data. You can read more about the rest of the subscriptions here."
1271,Subtasks and the JIRA Integration,"By default, JIRA subtasks are not imported into Wrike. However, once a JIRA issue is added to Wrike as a task, then you can convert the Wrike task into a subtask. Convert the synced task into a subtask of another synced task or add it as a subtask in a related, but non-synced, project. In either case, when you convert a synced task into a subtask:
Only the Wrike organizational structure is affected. In JIRA, the issue remains an issue and is not converted into a subtask.
The Wrike subtask remains synced with the JIRA issue and the synced fields continue to automatically update.
You can change the default settings so that subtasks are imported and automatically synced between Wrike and JIRA from the moment the sync is setup. Read more about how to change the default settings."
1272,Default Settings,"By default, JIRA subtasks are not imported into Wrike. However, once a JIRA issue is added to Wrike as a task, then you can convert the Wrike task into a subtask. Convert the synced task into a subtask of another synced task or add it as a subtask in a related, but non-synced, project. In either case, when you convert a synced task into a subtask:

*For more details, please visit the text formatting post on Unito’s site.
**During the first sync, the original estimate (from JIRA) is mapped to the Duration field (in Wrike). If the Duration or original estimate fields are updated, then the corresponding field in the other tool automatically updates as well. When the original estimate is updated, then JIRA automatically recalculates the remaining estimate.
***Please note: Users can only be added as assignees in Wrike or JIRA if they have a user license in that tool. If a user has both a Wrike and JIRA account, and they use the same email with both tools, then when they are assigned to something in one tool, they are automatically assigned to the synced item in the other tool. If a user has both a Wrike and JIRA account, but they use different emails with each tool, then you need to manually map their accounts. Note that users with the same emails will be automatically mapped between Wrike and Jira if the users existed in both Wrike and Jira before the sync was created. After Wrike and Jira are synced, it will be necessary to add user mapping for all the new users manually. It's also possible to re-create a sync with the same settings to map all users with matching emails automatically.
In addition to the fields above you can manually map:
Custom Workflows in JIRA to Custom Workflows in Wrike.
Priority in JIRA to Importance in Wrike.
Custom Fields

1278,Overview,"The Wrike and Jira two-way sync allows for automatic updates between Wrike tasks and Jira issues and epics. Select or create a Wrike project and select the Jira project that you’d like to sync with Wrike and:
Wrike creates a task for each issue or epic in the Jira project.
For any task created in, or added to, the synced subfolder in Wrike, Wrike creates a Jira issue in the synced project.
By default, tasks in Wrike turn into issues in Jira. If there are epics in a Jira project, they’re synced as tasks and the issues they contain are synced as separate tasks.
Once the sync is in place, Wrike tasks become linked with corresponding Jira issues. and when you update a linked task, the linked issue is automatically updated (and vice versa).
Please note: This page goes over how to sync projects between Wrike and Jira. For details on what you can do once the sync is in place, please see Wrike and JIRA Two-Way Sync: Overview."
1279,Important Information,"The Wrike and Jira two-way sync is powered by a partner: Unito.io.
Subtasks in Wrike are not synced along with their parent tasks by default. Syncing subtasks can be enabled after the creation of the sync as described on the Syncing Subtasks page of Unito's Help Center. For even more information about how the Wrike and Jira two-way sync works, please check out Unito’s Help Center.
When you set up the integration, a Wrike Bot is automatically created for you. The bot doesn't take up a Wrike user seat. A sync account is not automatically set up in Jira, and we strongly recommend creating one prior to setting up the first sync. You’ll find more details on how to do that below."
1280,Set Up the Sync,"Admins on Business and higher plans can enable the Wrike and Jira two-way sync.
The steps below are for setting up the sync with the Jira cloud solution. Details about how to sync with Jira’s on-premises solution are available on Unito’s Help Center.
There are three steps to creating your first sync:
Step 1: Enable project syncs add-on in your Wrike account
Step 2: Create a Jira test project and sync account
Step 3: Sync setup between Wrike and Jira
Before setting up the two-way sync between Wrike and Jira, you need to enable the Project Syncs Add-On in your Wrike account. You can find instructions on how to do that on the Project Syncs overview page.
Each sync setup begins with creating a folder or project in Wrike and a project in Jira that will be connected. To help you get a feel for how the sync works, create a test project in Wrike and in Jira and use these projects for your first sync.
Create a sync account in Jira to better track when updates are made as a result of the sync. If you use a sync account and a user updates a task’s title in Wrike, then in Jira you’ll see that the title of the synced issue was updated by the sync account. If you don’t use a sync account, then Jira will show that the user, whose credentials you selected to set up the sync, updated the issue.
To create a sync account, create a new Jira user and name it “Wrike Bot.” Visit Unito’s Help Center to read more about what permissions the Wrike Bot account requires. Make sure you give the bot account access to the Jira projects you want to sync.
Please note: You only need to create a sync account in Jira. In Wrike, there’s a special bot called “Unito Bot for Two-Way Sync” that is automatically added to your Wrike account when you set up the integration.
To create your first sync:
Click your profile image in the upper-right corner of the Wrike account.
Select “Apps and integrations.”
Click the “Project syncs” tab in the left panel.
(Optional) If there are multiple Wrike accounts associated with your email, select the relevant one.
Click the “Add sync” button.
You’ll see two cards on the screen for the two systems that you sync. The card on the right is reserved for Wrike by default.
Click the “Add another tool” option on the left card.
Select Jira and you’ll be prompted to log in.
Select how you want to log in to Jira. You have two options:
With an API token:
Enter your username.
Enter the API token.
If you don’t have the token, click the “Create API Token” hyperlink on the pop-up and follow the steps to create the token and use it for logging in.
With OAuth login:
Enter the domain of your Jira instance (the domain must be publicly reachable over the internet). An example domain is https://companyname.atlassian.com.
Click “Get Started.”
Follow the steps on the “Setup your Application Link” page. More detailed instructions for setting up Jira are available here.
Click “Connect Jira.”
Log in using the credentials of the bot account you created.
Click “Allow.”
In the “Project” drop-down, select the existing Jira project you wish to sync or create a new one.
After setting up the Jira card, select a connector for Wrike on the right card:
The “Wrike via Unito Bot for Two-Way Sync” option is selected automatically. If you keep this option selected, Jira will show that the bot has updated the issue. In this case, if you’re processing the first sync, you need to create a project or folder that will be integrated with Jira. That project or folder will be available for selection in the future syncs.
If you choose “Wrike via Username” option, then the updates in Jira will show that the user whose credentials you select to set up the sync updated the issue.
After both cards are set up, scroll down to choose the preferred sync direction.
Click “Next.” You’ll be directed to a page where you can configure filters.
Leave the filters as is to sync all issues and tasks by default.

With Zapier you can create customizable actions or “Zaps” that send information of your choosing from one app to another, freeing you from manual data input. In other words, you can automate the integration between Wrike and any other app or service which supports Zapier and get your work done faster."
1338,Popular Wrike Zaps,
1339,Set up a Zap,"Zaps are made of two parts: a trigger and a resulting action. For example, “If I write an Evernote note, then create a folder in Wrike,” or, “If there is an issue in GitHub, then create a task in Wrike.”
Triggers and actions of Wrike app are the following:
Triggers
Actions
Create a folder
Create a task
Create a task
Create a folder
Create a comment
Create a time entry
To start using Zapier, you are required to sign up for an account and login. The next step is to click ‘Make a Zap’ button and choose Wrike as a Trigger or an Action, e.g. “If a new event is added to your Google Calendar, create a task in Wrike for that”:
For your convenience, there is a Zapbook available listing all templates created by other Zapier users – https://zapier.com/app/explore.
Once you have chosen the apps and hit Continue, the page will guide you through the setup process assisting in setting up Trigger and Action details and conditions, and testing your Zap:
1. Enter your login credentials for the apps:
2. Fine tune the Trigger settings, for example define which Google Calendar should be linked to Wrike and set up filters if needed:
3. Once you reach the next step, you will be prompted to match up the Trigger to the Action. In our example the Action is to create a task in Wrike, so the setup page asks us to select the account and root folder/subfolder where the task should be created as well as define the task details: title, description, type, start and due dates, task importance and assignees.
4. The setup process is finished, it is necessary to test the Zap, name it and turn it on (in case of a successful test):
Notes: You can edit and remove a Zap on My Zaps page within your Zapier account.

Check if the right email is linked to the right account in the “Notifications settings” section.
Check the Spam/Junk folders in your mailbox to see if the email has landed there. If this is the case, make sure that noreply@wrike.com and wrike@wrike.com are whitelisted on the mail filters or the spam control software. You can also try whitelisting this IP range:
160.19.162.0/24, if your account is in our American data center
185.157.64.0/24, if your account is in our European data center
Check if six minutes have passed since you made any changes to the task. Wrike emails are sent 6 minutes after a change is made.
Check if you’ve received several emails about changes applied to one and the same task. Any changes that are made to a task within 6 minutes are compiled and sent in the same email.
If you haven’t received a Daily To-Do email or a Daily Digest email, check the schedule for these regular notification emails in your email notifications settings and make sure the time zone settings are correct.
If you activated the emails “All subtasks in task are completed” or “Next task in queue is ready to be started” in your email notifications settings, note that the 6-minute rule doesn’t apply for this type of notifications. The Wrike Bot will @mention you on a task once an hour. If more than an hour has passed and you still haven’t received an email, check the following:
Has someone @mentioned an assignee on a task which is ready to be worked on within an hour after the last predecessor or subtask is completed, canceled, or deferred? If yes, no email notification is sent.
Have you opened a parent task before Wrike Bot had a chance to @mention you and let you know that all subtasks were completed, canceled, or deferred? If yes, no email notification is sent.
New comments will trigger an email notification only in case of:
“Someone @mentions me” or “Someone comments without @mentioning me or my group” are activated in the email notifications settings.
You haven’t read the comment and 6 minutes have passed.
You have read the comment but didn’t change anything in the task and 6 minutes have passed.
If you have read the comment and some changes or comments were added to the task, no email notification will be sent in 6 minutes."

1404,Automatic Task Rescheduling,"Wrike automatically reschedules tasks whose schedule overlaps with non-working days in the assignee’s Work Schedule.
How rescheduling works:
Task duration remains intact (i.e. the length of time allotted for a task).
Task dates shift into the future. The number of days shifted depends on the number of non-working days.
Only active tasks scheduled for the future are rescheduled.
If a task has multiple assignees, task dates will only shift if all assignees have non-working day(s) during the task's scheduled dates.
If an account-wide exception has been created, or if the default schedule for all users in the account is changed by an admin, all the tasks will be rescheduled even if they are not shared with that admin.
Wrike warns you about automatic rescheduling when you:
Assign a Work Schedule to a user.

Only active tasks scheduled for the future are rescheduled.
If a task has multiple assignees, task dates will only shift if all assignees have non-working day(s) during the task's scheduled dates.

1596,Limitations of Single Sign-on,"Once SSO/SAML integration is enabled, users included in SSO won’t be able to:
Edit their names in Wrike. First and last names are attributed by your identity provider.
Have two or more Wrike accounts linked to one email address. If you have users who are members of several Wrike accounts, they will need to use a different email address to access other Wrike accounts, or merge their personal account into the main corporate account.
Make changes to their email address from their Wrike profile. This includes adding additional addresses. However, a Wrike admin can do this for them.
Enable 2-step verification through Wrike. If you’d like to protect your account with this security feature, it must be configured with your identity provider.
Log in to Wrike using a Wrike password. As a general rule, they will be redirected to the login page managed by your identity provider when trying to access Wrike in their browser. Some integrated tools don’t have native support for SSO (e.g. the Backup Tool and legacy API-v2 apps). SSO users will need to generate one-time passwords to authorize these tools. Please note that log in with Microsoft credentials or Google credentials will also not be possible."
1597,Decide the Scope of Single Sign-on,"How you set up your SSO depends on how you use (or plan to use Wrike). If:
Wrike is used only by company employees:SSO can be enabled for all users on the account.
Wrike is used by both company employees and non-employees: SSO can be enabled for users based on their email domain*.
Also, there is an “optional” choice - this means that everyone in the account will be able to login via password or IDP based login. This option is setup by default and it is useful for the purposes of testing the new SSO integration.
*Please note, in this case you need to add and approve email domains from the Security tab of the Account Management section before enabling SAML SSO. Users with emails with approved email domains are able to log in to Wrike via SSO and users with emails without approved email domains will log in via a Wrike username and password. Email domains must belong to the company in order to be approved.
If you wish to add additional approved domains after SSO is enabled, an admin must follow the same aforementioned process.
In most cases the approval process requires help from your System Ops team because the Domain Name System (DNS) records of the domains must be updated. We recommend adding approved domains before turning on SAML, so that they are applied immediately when SAML is enabled."
1598,Enabling Single Sign-on,
1599,Before enabling SSO it’s important to confirm that:,"The email address associated with each user's Wrike account matches their email in the company directory.

1601,Allow Users to Join Multiple SAML-Integrated Accounts,"Big enterprise teams that have several Wrike accounts with SAML-based SSO enabled via the same IDP can integrate all of their accounts into a single network. As a result, users can be invited to or join all connected Wrike accounts using their corporate credentials via the IDP.
Note: There are several prerequisites for implementation of this scheme, and it can only be enabled by Wrike Customer Support. Please contact Wrike Customer Support for more information."
1602,Overview,"Enterprise users can access Wrike with corporate credentials if SAML-based SSO (SSO/SAML integration) is enabled for their subscription. Single sign-on (SSO) is the general term for the various techniques which allow users to access multiple applications from a single authorization point, which is managed by an identity provider (IDP). Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML 2.0) is a leading industry standard for exchanging the authentication and authorization data that Wrike supports as a service provider (SP). No actual passwords are transferred to or from Wrike during the authorization event. Instead, Wrike receives a SAML assertion of the user identity, which is valid for a limited period of time and digitally signed.
For more details on how to enable SSO please check out our Single Sign-on Implementation Guide."

1629,Overview,"By default, Wrike Workspace data and attachments are protected by a foundational encryption; however, Wrike Lock provides an additional layer of encryption. It encrypts the keys to your encrypted Wrike data with a master encryption key that is stored with Amazon Web Services’ Key Management Service (AWS KMS), thereby allowing you to take control of access to your data. The master encryption key is owned and managed by you and resides outside of Wrike."
1630,Important Information,"You need an AWS KMS account to use Wrike Lock.
It is possible to create emergency recovery keys which can be used to decrypt an account if the encryption key or access to AWS KMS is lost.
All Wrike Workspace data (including Tasks, Folders, Projects, workflows, comments, and attachments) is encrypted."
1631,Benefits of Using Wrike Lock,"Control over your data even though it’s in the cloud. You can monitor, grant, and revoke access to your encryption/decryption master key using the AWS console.
An additional layer of encryption. Both your data and keys to it are encrypted."
1632,Set Up Wrike Lock with AWS KMS,"Step 1: Grant Wrike Access to the Key in Amazon KMS
Create an encryption key in one of the following regions:
us-east-1
us-east-2
us-west-1
us-west-2
eu-west-1
eu-central-1
eu-west-2
eu-west-3
Copy the key’s Amazon Resource Name and save it somewhere.
Step 2: Generate Emergency Recovery Keys (Optional)
Generate an asymmetric RSA key pair and export the public key in DER format encoded with a Base64 encoding. The recommended key length is 2048 bit or higher.
Sample commands (Linux/Unix/Mac OS):
> openssl genrsa -des3 -out wrike-recovery.pem 2048.
> openssl rsa -in wrike-recovery.pem -pubout -outform DER | base64 >wrike-recovery.der
Securely store the emergency recovery key somewhere safe. You can use HSM to store the key. Your private key will never be available to Wrike.
Copy the public key in DER format and save it somewhere.
Step 3: Encrypt Your Wrike Data
Contact us at support@team.wrike.com and let us know that you want to enable encryption for your account. Provide:
The key’s ARN you obtained at Step 1.
(if you generated emergency recovery keys at Step 2) The public emergency recovery key in DER format.
Our Support team will provide you with a Wrike’s AWS Account ID. Grant that Account ID access to the key.
We will help you choose the best time for the encryption to take place and will encrypt your account data."
1633,Emergency Recovery,"If your master encryption key is lost or is not accessible, contact us at support@team.wrike.com."
1634,The lead-up,"The disruptions on March 20th and March 21st were caused by a combination of two independent events, in two different parts of the system - developed by different teams, triggered by a new web application code that was released several days earlier. Because the effect of releasing the new code was delayed, the issue compounded gradually, and we didn’t notice it right away. The first alarm went off about an hour before the incident when there was an increase in the volume of requests between subsystems in our internal network. The on-call engineer immediately gathered a response team to investigate."
1635,Why only descriptions were affected,"Our description fields are supported by our real-time collaborative editor. This allows our users to not worry about versioning, overwritten edits, or waiting in line to collaborate. To allow this type of collaboration the editor works together with our Real-Time API (aka RTA), relying on its capability to quickly and efficiently deliver messages between an application and users. It also handles all other types of real-time communications, including Workspace updates, notifications, messaging, etc. At peak time, it can handle more than a million connected users. During this incident the RTA went down for the first time since its introduction to Wrike’s platform more than a year ago, taking all real-time features with it."
1636,What happened,"As mentioned above, a new code which was deployed to the web application a few days before the incident, created unnecessary internal traffic, increasing the number of requests between internal subsystems. We believe the catalyst for the problem was that a critical number of customers received this newly deployed version of Wrike over time. To protect themselves, subsystems started to throttle requests, causing increased wait times, system timeouts, and retries. The first problem we had here is that these timeouts were uncoordinated between different subsystems, causing them to fail and retry at different rates, making things worse over time. The second problem was that we had recently enabled verbose logging (a logging mode for capturing more detailed information) for RTA diagnostics. Once the system couldn’t handle writing logs at this rate, one of the RTA servers went down, causing all connected clients to drop, reconnect to the remaining servers, and ultimately creating even more pressure on the system overall."
1637,What we did,"By the time we identified the problem, the full response team was on call and was working hard to resolve the situation. During those hours we started increasing infrastructure capacity while simultaneously delivering fixes for different parts of the application, including the web client. At the same we started throttling part of our users on a network level, blocking their access to the RTA servers to reduce the load. However, the catch was that in order to deliver a fix for the cause of the root problem – the web client application code – we had to force users to reload their browsers. This was impossible because putting up a message in the Workspace indicating that a reload was necessary required RTA, which was unavailable. Coordinated work between ops and developers allowed us to deliver server fixes and throttling a portion of the user base allowed us to reduce load and push through necessary web application fixes."
1638,Why this happened a second time,"Code changes made in a rush are usually not something we want to keep for the long run, so we spent the next 24 hours analyzing the problem and refining our solutions. By the time production-quality code was ready to be released the peak load for the next day was approaching, and still, a large part of our user base was running the old, affected version of the code. However this time the fixes we deployed, together with smarter throttling, targeted primarily users running this old version, pushing them gradually through updates. While this partial disruption spanned 2.5 hours, it only affected a portion of our user base with possible short disruptions for others."
1639,What happened in April,"The reasons for the disruptions in April were completely different from those that caused the issues in March. This time, one of our system engineers was working on provisioning new servers, and while setting up a network he ran a sequence of commands which caused an unexpected side effect which created a network loop in one of our database segments. Our OPS team fixed the issue in under 15 minutes, but then something else happened.
One of our goals internally on the operations team is to provide high availability (HA) with the help of automatic failover for everything, including our databases. A few months ago we introduced a new HA agent to our infrastructure, which we put through tens of different test cases to make sure it works in all conditions we could imagine. We also had a procedure so that in case of an unforeseen event, the HA agent could be put in manual mode to avoid unnecessary failovers. Unexpectedly, while in manual mode, the agent had an internal timeout, which was not documented by the vendor, and under the conditions of the network loop (as described above), it woke up and demoted several database clusters. This caused 50% of our database shards holding task descriptions, to suddenly become read-only. This was not immediately obvious to the OPS team because from the monitoring side, it looked like the real-time editing engine stopped working, and our team was initially trying to find an issue within the application. Once the application had thrown its first errors several minutes later, that it could not write to the database, the problem became clear and our engineers started the process of relaunching the database cluster, one by one. 40 minutes later, the majority were up and running without any loss of data. We had to temporarily shut down one of the shards for additional maintenance half an hour later, closing the 2 hours span for the incident."
1640,Addressing the problem,"For all of our production incidents, we run a “5 whys” root cause analysis to determine why an incident occurred and what we need to do to improve or prevent similar incidents in the future. We identified 15 critical action items, 11 of those were completed within the first 48 hours, and the rest were completed a few days later. We also compiled a list of procedures and actions that need to be improved, including infrastructure and application improvements, better monitoring to detect problems before they become user-facing, new scenarios for load testing, and reducing the amount of time required to fix a problem.
We hold ourselves to the highest standard and have consistently exceeded our uptime goals in the past. Our disaster recovery site is always available if you need read-only access to any of your data. We’re taking steps to earn your trust back and are working to ensure that this won’t happen again in the future."
1641,Overview,"When you send an email to Wrike via the email integration (for example emailing wrike@wrike.com), Wrike checks to see if the email is coming from a valid source. If something suspicious is detected, we won’t make the requested change to your Wrike Workspace and you will receive a return message letting you know that your update has not been posted.
We do this to protect your Wrike account from malicious updates."

1687,Include BI Export Data in Backup,"Enterprise account owners and admins with the right to “Export account data” can include BI export data in the backup.
BI Export lets you export your account’s data for future import to third-party analytics tools. To include it in the backup:
Click your profile image in the Workspace's upper right-hand corner.
Select ""Settings"" from the dropdown.
Click ""Settings"" in the left panel.
Check the ""Include BI export data in backup"" box.
BI export data will be included to the backup when it's performed by any admin with the rights to both ""Export account data"" and ""Configure Account Settings""."
1688,Overview,"2-step verification (also called two-factor authentication or 2fa) provides an extra layer of security to the sign in process: it requires you to enter a time sensitive verification code after you enter your username and password.
When you enter the security code, you have the option to “Remember this computer”. Choose this option to bypass the second authentication step for the next 30 days when accessing Wrike from that particular computer. If you choose this option, please be sure to lock your computer when you walk away from it.
2-step verification can be enabled for specific users or for all users who are part of the same account."
1689,Important Information,"If you have 2-step verification enabled, you can use one-time passwords to log in to applications which do not natively support 2-step verification. Note: In Enterprise accounts with 2-step verification, one-time password usage may be disabled. If you need to use a one-time password, contact your account administrator or owner to enable this option.
Wrike does not support verification codes that are delivered via text message.
Recovery codes are only valid once. Each time you reconfigure or reset 2-step verification settings, a new recovery code is generated.
If you use Google Auth (or another SSO provider) to log in to Wrike, then 2-step authentication is handled through them. G Suite customers can easily enable2-step verification with Google.
You can read about the advanced practices we employ in our Security overview."
1690,Authentication Apps,"To use 2-step verification you must have an authentication app, on your mobile phone or tablet, which can generate time-based, one-time passwords. 2-step verification can be configured to work with applications that use Time-Based, One-Time Password Algorithm (TOTP) for generating access codes from a shared secret key.
Please note,authenticator apps generate valid codes even when your device has no phone or data connectivity.
We recommend different authentication apps, depending on the type of phone you use:
iOS: Google Authenticator app from iTunes.
Android: Google Authenticator app from the Google Play Store.
Windows: Microsoft Authenticator app from the Windows Store.
Potential additional services include: 1Password, Authy, Duo Mobile, Yubikey with TOTP."
1691,Enable 2-Step Verification (for a user license),"Download an authentication app on your mobile phone or tablet.
From the Wrike Workspace, click on your profile image in the upper right-hand corner of the Workspace.
Select “Settings” from the dropdown.
""Profile"" opens by default.
Scroll to “Password & 2-Step Verification” section.
Click “Enable”.
Follow the prompts generated by the configuration wizard. You will be asked to enter your Wrike password and confirm that your preferred authenticator app is installed on your mobile device.
Enter a 6-digit verification code generated by your authenticator app and click “Verify”.
Wrike will provide a recovery code. Please make sure to keep this code, it's only shown once, and you will need it if you ever need to disable 2-step verification and access your account."
1692,Enable 2-Step Verification (for all users on a subscription),"This action must be done by an account admin.Please note,if 2-step verification is turned on for the whole account, then individual users aren't able to disable 2-step verification for their user license, an admin must do it for them.
Before enabling 2-step verification for all users on the account, we recommend you:
Instruct team members to enable 2-step verification on their personal profiles first.
Confirm that everyone has enabled 2-step verification (you can check progress from the “2-step verification” section of the Security tab on Account Management).
Once everyone has enabled 2-step verification for their user license, turn on 2-step verification for all users who are part of the account:
Click on your profile image in the Workspace's upper right-hand corner.
Select ""Settings"" from the dropdown.
Click ""Security"" in the left panel.
Locate the section on Two-step verification.
Select the radio button next to “Obligatory for all users”.
Click “Save changes”.
Click “Confirm”.
Users who haven’t enabled 2-step verification will be logged out of Wrike and will have to configure 2-step verification as soon as 2fa is enabled for the whole account.
Once 2-step verification is turned on for everyone, all current account members will receive an email about it. New members who join the account will be prompted to configure 2-step verification when they confirm their invitations."
1693,Reconfigure 2-Step Verification,"If you would like to use 2-step verification with a different mobile device, you can reconfigure your settings. We recommend installing an authenticator app on your new phone before reconfiguring your 2-step verification settings.
Click your profile image in the Workspace's upper right-hand corner.
Select ""Settings"" from the dropdown.
""Profile"" opens by default.
Click “Reconfigure” under the heading “Two Step verification”.
Click “Reconfigure” on the pop-up which appears.
Enter your password and press “Continue”.
Follow the setup wizard’s prompts to reconfigure your settings.
If you have two-step verification enabled, but no longer have access to your phone, you can:
Click the “Lost your mobile device?” link on the Wrike login page. You will be prompted to enter the recovery code which was generated when you were enabling 2-step verification for your account. If you do not remember your recovery code you can click ""Can't provide a code"" and a message will be sent to your account administrator informing them that you have been locked out of your account.
Contact one of your account admins so that they can temporarily disable 2-step verification for you. You can then login and reconfigure your 2-step verification settings."
1694,Disable 2-Step Verification for a User's License,"If 2-step verification has been turned on for all users on a subscription, then a user cannot turn off 2-step verification for their user account, but an admin can do it for them. 
Click on your profile image in the upper right-hand corner of the Workspace.
Select ""Settings"" from the dropdown.
Click ""Users"" in the left panel.
Select the user who you need to disable 2-step verification for.
Click the “Off” option to the right of the “2-step verification” heading.
Please note, if 2-step verification is turned on for the account, then disabling 2-step verification is temporary and the user will be asked to enable the security feature when they sign in to their Workspace."

*Users who have an account with the Wrike for Professional Services package and Wrike Resource add-on can track time on the go in the Android app's Timesheets. Wrike connects your Timesheets with Google Calendar to easily add time spent on meetings and other scheduled tasks. The app automatically offers to integrate your Google Calendar when you open Timesheets. Additionally, in Timesheets you can see billable and non-billable time totals, a weekly summary of tracked time, and highlights for tasks that require your attention.
Activity is a special mobile version of the Stream tab that contains additional features, allowing you to track detailed changes and make timely adjustments on-the-go.
With Activity, you can stay on top of all your running assignments to make sure you don’t miss any updates in active tasks. Activity shows you:
Dates and status changes (including the info about the previous status)
New comments including those that don’t @mention you directly
Approval updates
Changes in attachments
Other updates in tasks you follow. If a task is irrelevant to you, swipe it to the left and Wrike will stop showing it in Activity.
By default, Activity will send you a daily push notification with all your latest updates consolidated in one place. You can disable the push notifications in Settings > Activity notifications.
In the daily Activity digest you can:

Edit existing tasks (add dates and assignees) in folders and projects you opened while online.
Edit descriptions of tasks you opened while online.

This page describes how to enable and access project progress in the Android app. To read more about the progress metrics and how they’re calculated, visit the Project Progress overview page.
Note: In the Android app, progress is displayed only for projects that have a start and finish date and have enough tasks to calculate progress.

In the Android app, all users who have access to the project can enable or disable project progress.

Tap the slider button next to “Color coding.”
In the app, project health has the following colors:
